L. 118-50, div. H) regulates \u201cforeign adversary controlled applications,\u201d specifically those operated by TikTok and any other subsidiary of its China-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., on national security grounds.\n\nSection 2(a) of the Act prohibits entities from distributing, maintaining, or updating certain defined foreign adversary controlled applications within the territory of the United States by providing (A) services for such distribution, maintenance, or updates by means of an online mobile application store or other marketplace; or (B) internet hosting services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications. \u00a0Section 2(g) of the Act defines \u201cForeign Adversary Controlled Application\u201d to include websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, and augmented or immersive technology applications operated directly or indirectly by ByteDance Ltd. or TikTok. \u00a0Under section 2(a) of the Act, the prohibitions of the Act with respect to these entities became effective on January 19, 2025.\n\nI have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions. \u00a0To fulfill those responsibilities, I intend to consult with my advisors, including the heads of relevant departments and agencies on the national security concerns posed by TikTok, and to pursue a resolution that protects national security while saving a platform used by 170 million Americans. \u00a0My Administration must also review sensitive intelligence related to those concerns and evaluate the sufficiency of mitigation measures TikTok has taken to date.\n\nThe unfortunate timing of section 2(a) of the Act \u2014 one day before I took office as the 47th President of the United States \u2014 interferes with my ability to assess the national security and foreign policy implications of the Act\u2019s prohibitions before they take effect. \u00a0This timing also interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns. \u00a0Accordingly, I am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Action*.*\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok. \u00a0During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act. \u00a0In light of this direction, even after the expiration of the above-specified period, the Department of Justice shall not take any action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period or any period prior to the issuance of this order, including the period of time from January 19, 2025, to the signing of this order.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to issue written guidance to implement the provisions of subsection (a).\n\n(c) \u00a0I further order the Attorney General to issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct that occurred during the above-specified period, as well as for any conduct from the effective date of the Act until the issuance of this Executive Order.\n\n(d)\u00a0 Because of the national security interests at stake and because section 2(d) of the Act vests authority for investigations and enforcement of the Act only in the Attorney General, attempted enforcement by the States or private parties represents an encroachment on the powers of the Executive.\u00a0 The Attorney General shall exercise all available authority to preserve and defend the Executive\u2019s exclusive authority to enforce the Act.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0General Provisions*.* \u00a0(a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order, issued on January 20, 2025, addresses the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act regarding TikTok. The Order temporarily halts enforcement of the Act's prohibitions for 75 days, allowing the new administration time to assess national security implications and negotiate potential resolutions. The President directs the Attorney General to: (1) refrain from enforcement actions during this period, (2) issue implementing guidance, (3) provide written assurance to providers regarding non-violation, and (4) defend federal exclusivity in enforcement. The Order acknowledges TikTok's widespread use by 170 million Americans while balancing national security concerns regarding ByteDance Ltd.'s control.",
