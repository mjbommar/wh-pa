  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, reinstates and modifies Executive Order 13957 from the previous administration, creating a new employment category called 'Schedule Policy/Career' (formerly Schedule F) within the federal workforce. The order aims to increase accountability for federal employees in policy-influencing positions by making them more easily removable and directly accountable to the President. It establishes that while these employees aren't required to personally support the administration's politics, they must faithfully implement its policies or face dismissal. The order revokes EO 14003 which had previously protected certain federal workforce provisions and directs the Office of Personnel Management to amend Civil Service Regulations accordingly.",
  "eli5": "The President made a new rule that makes it easier to fire government workers who don't follow the rules or do their jobs properly, especially those who help make important decisions. It's like making sure the people who work for the President actually do what they're supposed to do.",
  "issues": [
    "Potential conflicts with existing civil service protections and merit system principles",
