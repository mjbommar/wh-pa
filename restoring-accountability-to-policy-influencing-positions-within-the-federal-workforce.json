They are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President. \u00a0Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.\u201d\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Conforming Regulatory Changes. \u00a0The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (Director) shall promptly amend the Civil Service Regulations to rescind all changes made by the final rule of April 9, 2024, \u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles,\u201d 89 *Fed. Reg.* 24982, that impede the purposes of or would otherwise affect the implementation of Executive Order 13957. \u00a0Until such rescissions are effectuated (including the resolution of any judicial review), 5 CFR part 302, subpart F, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(3), and 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) shall be held inoperative and without effect.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Additional Positions for Consideration. \u00a0Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director shall, after consultation with the Executive Office of the President, issue guidance about additional categories of positions that executive departments and agencies should consider recommending for Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSec. 6. \u00a0Revocation. \u00a0Executive Order 14003 of January 22, 2021 (Protecting the Federal Workforce), is hereby revoked, and any rules, regulations, guidance, or other agency policies effectuated under Executive Order 14003 shall not be enforced. \u00a0The heads of each executive department and agency shall review and identify existing agency actions relating to or arising under section 3(e)(v) and 3(f) of Executive Order 14003 (relating to suspending, revising, or rescinding revisions to discipline and unacceptable performance policies) and, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind such actions identified in the review.\n\nSec. 7.\u00a0 General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, reinstates and modifies Executive Order 13957 from the prior administration, creating a new employment category called 'Schedule Policy/Career' (formerly Schedule F) within the federal workforce. The order aims to increase accountability for federal employees in policy-influencing positions by making them more easily removable and directly accountable to the President. The order cites concerns about career civil servants resisting executive leadership policies and notes low confidence among supervisors in their ability to remove problematic employees. Key changes include new position classifications, modified adverse action procedures, and requirements for employees to faithfully implement administration policies regardless of personal political views.",
  "eli5": "This order makes it easier for the President to hire and fire certain government workers who help make important decisions, even if they usually have special job protection. It's like changing the rules so the boss (the President) can more easily replace workers who don't follow instructions.",
