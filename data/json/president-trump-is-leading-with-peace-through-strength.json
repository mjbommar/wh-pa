  "summary": "President Trump is focusing on reinforcing American foreign policy through a strategy termed 'Peace through Strength'. This involves securing the release of American hostages from various countries, engaging in diplomacy with global leaders to promote peace, and exerting pressure on regimes like Iran through sanctions. Trump has also restored certain policies and imposed new restrictions to reflect his administration's priorities in international relations and security.\n\nDomestically, President Trump aims to enhance the U.S. military's capabilities by achieving high recruitment numbers and reinstating service members affected by previous mandates. He has made several administrative changes such as appointing Lt. Gen. Dan 'Razin' Caine as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and dismissed boards suspected of ideologically compromising the military. Additionally, Trump worked on strategic economic and defense initiatives with countries like Japan and India, and rolled back certain policies perceived as 'woke'.",
