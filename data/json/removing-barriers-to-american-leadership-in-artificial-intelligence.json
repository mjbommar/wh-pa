  "summary": "On January 23, 2025, a new executive order was issued by the President of the United States to maintain and enhance America's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). The order aims to dismantle existing AI policies and directives that impede innovation, thereby solidifying the nation's position as a global leader in AI. This initiative highlights the importance of fostering AI systems free of bias to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\n\nThe order mandates the creation of an AI action plan within 180 days, which will be led by various high-level advisors and government officials, including the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Additionally, certain existing regulations that may hinder AI development are subject to review and potential revision or rescission, particularly those introduced under Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023. This includes revising memorandum M-24-10 and M-24-18 to align with the new policy.\n\nIn implementing this order, all actions must be consistent with existing laws, emphasizing that no new rights or benefits are created against the U.S. government. The White House seeks to ensure the existing authority and roles of agencies are not impaired while facilitating this update.",
