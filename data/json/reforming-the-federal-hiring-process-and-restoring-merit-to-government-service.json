  "summary": "The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on January 20, 2025, which aims to reform the federal hiring process and restore merit-based practices. It outlines a plan for recruiting a highly skilled federal workforce that aligns with American values and constitutional principles, while eliminating biases based on race, sex, or religion in hiring decisions. The order mandates the creation of a Federal Hiring Plan that focuses on efficiency and technological integration to streamline the hiring process. \n\nIn this order, federal agencies are instructed to improve their recruitment strategies by adopting modern technologies, reducing the time-to-hire to under 80 days, and enhancing communication with candidates. The plan involves collaboration between various government offices to ensure each agency develops specific strategies suited to their needs. Furthermore, performance metrics will be introduced to measure the success of these reforms, and regular consultations are required to monitor their progress.\n\nThe order also specifies that the federal hiring practices should not undermine or affect existing legal authorities or budgetary functions within the government. It does not create any enforceable rights for individuals against the government and is subject to congressional appropriations for its implementation.",
