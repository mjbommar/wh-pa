EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Great honor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m thrilled to welcome the Prime Minister of India, my friend, Narendra Modi back to the White House.\u00a0 We spent a lot of time here and a lot of time in India, and he\u2019s a very special man.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prime Minister, it is a pleasure to extend to you the same hospitality that you showed Melania and myself when we traveled to your beautiful country five years ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe so long ago, and it seemed like yesterday.\u00a0 It was beautiful.\u00a0 We opened the cricket stadium \u2014 129,000 seats, I think the largest stadium in the world, and it was an incredible period of time.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is truly a special bond between the United States and India and the world\u2019s oldest democracy and the world\u2019s largest democracy and, I believe, the world\u2019s largest country, in terms of the numbers of people.\u00a0 And today, the prime minister and I are announcing a framework to strengthen those ties even further economically, and the U.S.-India compact for the 21st century is a historic initiative that will deepen every aspect of our partnership and our friendship.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Starting this year, we\u2019ll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars.\u00a0 We\u2019re also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad security partnership.\u00a0 In our meeting today, the prime minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it\u2019s crucial really to maintaining peace and prosperity, tranquility even, in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, the United States and India will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat all over the world actually.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and one of the very evil people of the world and having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India.\u00a0 So, he\u2019s going to be going back to India to face justice.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we deepen our defense partnership, we\u2019ll also strengthen our economic ties and bring greater fairness and reciprocity to our trading relationship.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a signal of good faith, Prime Minister Modi recently announced the reductions to India\u2019s unfair, very strong tariffs that limit U.S. access into the Indian market very strongly.\u00a0 And really, it\u2019s big problem, I must say.\u00a0 India imposes a 30 to 40 to 60 and even 70 percent tariff on so many of the goods and, in some cases, far more than that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As an example, a 70 percent tariff on U.S. cars going into India, which makes it pretty much impossible to sell those cars.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, the U.S. trade deficit with India is almost $100 billion, and Prime Minister Modi and I have agreed that we\u2019ll begin negotiations to address the long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years \u2014 but they didn\u2019t do that \u2014 in the U.S.-India trading relationship, with the goal of signing an agreement.\u00a0 And we want \u2014 really, we want a certain level playing field, which we really think we\u2019re entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we\u2019re going to work on that very hard.\u00a0 And we can make up the difference very easily with the deficit with the sale of oil and gas and LNG, of which we have more than anybody in the world.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prime minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will restore the United States as a leading supplier of oil and gas to India.\u00a0 It will be, hopefully, their number-one supplier in the groundbreaking development for U.S. nuclear industry.\u00a0 India is also reforming its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology, which is at the highest level, into the Indian market.\u00a0 This will bring safe, clean, and affordable electricity to millions of Indians and tens of billions of dollars to the U.S.-civilian nuclear industry in India.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And under the framework we are announcing today, the United States and India are also joining forces to ensure that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are developed by the two of the most \u2014 really, two of the most advanced nations, intellectually and otherwise technologically, anywhere in the world.\u00a0 There\u2019s nobody very much closer.\u00a0 We have an incredible relationship there.\u00a0 And this is where it seems to be heading.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And artificial intelligence \u2014 complex \u2014 a very complex subject, but it seems to be where people want to be and they want to go, and we\u2019re leading right now by a lot, but other people will try to catch us.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be able to.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it available.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make tremendous amounts of electricity available, and we\u2019re going to let the people that are buying the electricity make their own electric plants \u2014 electric generation plants, and we\u2019ve never done this in our country, but we\u2019re going to get it done very quickly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lee Zeldin and his group are going to get the approvals in very rapid form.\u00a0 And we\u2019re calling it a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what it is.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to be \u2014 we\u2019re going to remain at the top of the AI or artificial intelligence, I think, for a long time to come, and we\u2019re going to be working very closely with India and other countries on that.\u00a0 But right now, we\u2019re the leader by quite a bit.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history.\u00a0 It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States, connecting our partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables \u2014 many, many undersea cables.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big development.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of money going to be spent, and we\u2019ve already spent some, but we\u2019re going to be spending a lot more in order to stay advanced and stay the leader.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m pleased to report that with today\u2019s announcements, the friendship between the United States and India is the strongest I believe it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 I think our relationship is the best it\u2019s ever been between two leaders of the two countries, and it\u2019s an honor to say that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019d like to now invite the prime minister to say a few words, and then we\u2019ll take some questions.\u00a0 And we appreciate you all being here.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Your Excellency President Trump, delegates of both countries, friends from the media: *Namashkar*.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would like to first of all express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear friend President Trump for the grand welcome and hospitality accorded to me.\u00a0 President Trump\u2019s leadership has been instrumental in nurturing India-U.S. ties and making them vibrant.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I could feel today the same enthusiasm, the same \u2014 the same enthusiasm, the same energy, the same commitment that we had worked with during our first term.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our discussions today highlighted our pride in our accomplishments during his first term, the deep mutual trust that we share, and also the resolve to attain new goals.\u00a0 We also agreed that the partnership and cooperation between India and the U.S. can shape a better world.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, the people of America are aware of President Trump\u2019s motto, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d or \u201cMAGA.\u201d\u00a0 The people are well aware of it.\u00a0 The people of India too are focusing on both heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace and with a firm resolve to ensure a developed India by 2047.\u00a0 If I were to say this, borrowing an expression from America, our vision for a developed India is to \u201cMake India Great Again,\u201d or \u201cMIGA.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When America and India work together, that is when MAGA \u2014 when it\u2019s MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes mega \u2014 a mega partnership for prosperity.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And it is this mega spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, today, we have also set ourselves the target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030.\u00a0 Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to ensure India\u2019s energy security, we will focus on trade in oil and gas.\u00a0 Investment in energy infrastructure will also increase.\u00a0 In the area of nuclear energy, we also discussed increasing cooperation on small modular reactors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, America plays an important role in India\u2019s defense preparedness.\u00a0 As strategic and trusted partners, we are moving forward actively towards joint development, joint production, and transfer of technology.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the times to come as well, new technologies and equipment will enhance our capacities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have decided to launch the autonomous systems industry alliance and a defense cooperation framework for the next decade will be prepared.\u00a0 Defense interoperability, logistics, repair, and maintenance will also be its key components.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, the 21st century is a technology-driven century.\u00a0 Close cooperation in the area of technology between countries that believe in democratic values can give new direction, strength, and opportunities to the entire humanity.\u00a0 India and the U.S. will jointly work in areas of artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum, biotechnology, and several other technologies.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, we also agreed on TRUST, which stands for Transforming Relationships Utilizing Strategic Technology.\u00a0 Under this, our focus will be on establishing strong supply chains for critical minerals, advanced materials, and pharmaceuticals.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have also decided to launch a recovery and processing initiative for strategic minerals like lithium and rare earths.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have had close cooperation with the U.S. in the area of space.\u00a0 The NISAR satellite developed with mutual cooperation between Israel and NASA will soon be flying into space on an Indian launch vehicle.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, partnership between India and the U.S. strengthens democracy and strengthens democratic values and systems.\u00a0 We will work together to enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.\u00a0 The Quad will play a special role in this.\u00a0 During the Quad summit scheduled to be held in India this year, we will expand cooperation in new areas with our partner countries.\u00a0 Under the IMEEC and I2U2, we will work together for the development of economic corridors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And in the area of connectivity, India and U.S. will stand strongly together in the fight against terrorism.\u00a0 We agree that in order to eliminate cross-border terrorism, we need concrete actions, and I\u2019m very grateful to President Trump that he \u2014 in 2008, somebody who carried out genocide in India, that criminal is now going to be handed over to India, and I\u2019m grateful to President Trump for this, and appropriate action will be taken in the courts in India.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Friends, the Indian community living in the U.S. is an important link in our relations. \u00a0In order to further deepen our people-to-people ties, India will soon open new consulates in Los Angeles and Boston.\u00a0 These will be new consulates.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have invited American universities and educational institutes to open their offshore campuses in India.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, I am grateful to you for your friendship and strong commitment towards India.\u00a0 The people of India still fondly remember your visit in 2020 and hope that President Trump will come and visit them again.\u00a0 On behalf of 1.4 billion Indians, I invite you to visit India.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Great job.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Beautiful.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, thank you very much.\u00a0 That was excellent.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ll do a few questions, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Please, go ahead.\u00a0 Please, go ahead.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Yeah, blue shirt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 People in India will naturally welcome your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India back home.\u00a0 In that context, I would like to ask you a question about \u2014 in last few years, we have seen several groups in the U.S. been raising anti-India voice, calling about separation \u2014 terrorism activities in India.\u00a0 Do you think that should continue here in the U.S. as well?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have to go louder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, people in India would be welcoming your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, I can\u2019t understand \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 \u2014 a word he\u2019s saying.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the \u2014 it\u2019s the accent.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little bit tough for me.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But can I try again?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 How about \u2014 how about you.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Go ahead, back there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you.\u00a0 First, I want to ask the prime minister a question.\u00a0 You and the president \u2014 you both spoke about combating ISIS.\u00a0 You \u2014 you both sounded very exciting about this \u2014 excited about this partnership upcoming, and I \u2014 I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country that there will be peace through strength and you will have a suc- \u2014 successful partnership with the United States, versus with Biden\u2019s incompetence and weakness over the last four years?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s your question, but I\u2019ll answer it.\u00a0 I agree with you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Yeah, gross incompetence.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a fantastic relationship.\u00a0 And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States, but I think we\u2019ve taken care of it in just three weeks.\u00a0 It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn\u2019t prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it \u2014 not only our country, but the whole world.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The prime minister told me that before too.\u00a0 Even over India, the world has a light.\u00a0 They need the United States to be strong and powerful but good, and I think that\u2019s happened.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s happened in a very short period of time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I will tell you, we\u2019re going to have a fantastic relationship, and it will make both countries much stronger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, go ahead, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Geeta Mohan from India today, sir.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just take my colleague Lalit Jha\u2019s question forward, because you couldn\u2019t underst- \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Fine.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question is about the fact that you\u2019ve decided to extradite Tahawwur Rana.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 India has been waiting to \u2014 to have him back in India to bring him to justice.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separates who\u2019ve been working against Indian interests.\u00a0 How is the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India?\u00a0 There are \u2014 there have been allegations that have been leveled against Indian agencies by the Biden administration.\u00a0 Are you going to relook that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration.\u00a0 Biden \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because, you know, it\u2019s a good thing to do.\u00a0 And a lot of things happened that weren\u2019t very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration \u2014 the Biden administration.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But as you said, we\u2019re giving a very violent man \u2014 it seems to me \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s been convicted yet or will be, but let\u2019s assume he\u2019s a pretty violent person \u2014 we\u2019re giving him back to India immediately.\u00a0 And there are more to follow, because we have quite a few requests.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, we work with India on crime, and we want to make it good for India, and it\u2019s very important.\u00a0 So, that kind of a relationship is very important to us.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019ve repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs.\u00a0 You announced reciprocal tariffs today.\u00a0 I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect.\u00a0 Are you willing to make any concessions, and how can India head off these tariffs?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also have one for the prime minister.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, India has been, to us, just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been very strong on tariffs, and I don\u2019t blame them, necessarily, but it\u2019s a different way of doing business.\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are right now a reciprocal nation.\u00a0 We are going to \u2014 if it\u2019s India or if it\u2019s somebody else with low tariffs, we\u2019re going to have the same.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have whatever India charges, we\u2019re charging them.\u00a0 Whatever another country charges, we\u2019re charging them.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to do that in my other term, and we had the greatest economy ever in the world.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been an economy like we had, and then we got hit with COVID.\u00a0 We had a focus on that, and I wasn\u2019t really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and we didn\u2019t do the tariffs.\u00a0 We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided \u2014 and I decided, I think, on a human basis \u2014 on a humane basis not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world.\u00a0 The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But now we\u2019re doing \u2014 we see a tremendous future for our country.\u00a0 But we felt that now it\u2019s finally time, after 45 or 50 years of abuse, that we will do \u2014 and this isn\u2019t India, this is among a lot of nations.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union is very difficult for us \u2014 very, very difficult.\u00a0 They tax our companies at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u00a0 They take advantage of a lot of things.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re not happy about that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China, of course, is terrible, and we\u2019ve never taken in 10 cents until I was president.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I\u2019ve been president \u2014 in first term and now \u2014 and we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, we are being reciprocal with India.\u00a0 Whatever India charges, we charge them.\u00a0 So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge \u2014 I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high, and I was unable to get a concession.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re just going to do it the easy way, and we\u2019re just going to say, \u201cWhatever you charge, we charge.\u201d\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s fair for the people of the United States, and I think it\u2019s actually fair for India.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you willing to make any concessions, sir?\u00a0 Are you willing to make any concessions, sir?\u00a0 Any concessions?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\u00a0 Ask to the prime minister, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A question for the prime minister, please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Ask to the prime minister, please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sorry.\u00a0 Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India.\u00a0 Prime Minist- \u2014 thank you, Mr. President.\n\nPrime Minister, the U.S. is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration, and India has been cooperating on this issue.\u00a0 How does India see this issue in the larger context?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t think this is a question that is about India only, but, even globally, you can talk about this issue.\u00a0 And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they \u2014 they have absolutely no right to be in that country.\u00a0\n\nAnd as far as India and the U.S. is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion, and that is that any verified Indian who is in the U.S. illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India.\u00a0 However, it doesn\u2019t stop there.\u00a0\n\nThese are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and big promises.\u00a0 A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they are going to a country.\u00a0 And, in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system, and we have to make sure that we fight against this system.\u00a0\n\nAs far as the U.S. and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking.\u00a0 And basically, the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants, and our bigger fight, actually, is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive.\u00a0 And I can tell you that India will completely support your endeavor in achieving this.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 A question for Prime Minister Modi first, if I may.\u00a0 I wanted to ask you: Did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your \u2014 your meetings today, Mr. Prime Minister?\n\nAnd, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you: Today, you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President Xi and President Putin.\u00a0 What would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you\u2019re apparently more keen to speak to America\u2019s adversaries than to its allies?\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, maybe I\u2019ll just go and \u2014 first on this one.\u00a0 We had some talks, and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people \u2014 largely, they overlap \u2014 \u201cYou have to pay more money because it\u2019s unfair what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a tremendous amount more.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight, and Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money.\u00a0 It\u2019s not equitable, and we want to see a counterbalance.\u00a0 We want to have them put up more money.\u00a0 They have to do that.\n\nAt the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day \u2014 yesterday.\u00a0 And we also had a very good conversation \u2014 I did, both \u2014 in both cases \u2014 with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re going to be able to do something.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to be able to make a deal, and I hope so, because it\u2019s a horrible war.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least, already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like \u2014 nobody has ever seen anything like it since \u2014 certainly since the Second World War.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, I think we\u2019re going to be able to do something.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin, and my impression is that they \u2014 I know that President Zelenskyy wants to make a deal, and I also feel that \u2014 I know that President Putin wants to make a deal.\u00a0 I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions.\u00a0\n\nBut the meeting and the \u2014 the conversation \u2014 also, the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one, and my phone call with him was a very successful one.\u00a0\n\nPlease.\u00a0\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 You asked a question regarding Elon Musk.\u00a0 I have known him for a very long time.\u00a0 I was not even prime minister at the time when I first met him; I was chief minister.\u00a0 And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children.\u00a0 And so, we had a nice discussion.\u00a0\n\nAs far as the EV is concerned \u2014 EVs are concerned, the EV \u2014 the word \u201cEV\u201d has a copyright.\u00a0 And that is one person who has a copyright for the word \u201cEV,\u201d and that is Trump.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That was very nice.\n\nGo ahead, please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani, who\u2019s one of the weal- \u2014 the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi?\u00a0\n\nPrime Minister Modi, have you asked the president to take action on that case?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Firstly, India is a democratic country, and our culture and our thought philosophy is *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam*, which basically means that the entire world is a family.\u00a0 Every Indian is my own family member.\u00a0 And when it comes to such personal matters, two cou- \u2014 leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which one?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 \u00a0Sir, go ahead, please.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.\u00a0 I have a question for you as well.\u00a0\n\nBut, Mr. President, you have suggested \u2014 with regards to the Russia-Ukraine war, you\u2019ve suggested several things that Ukraine should give up: the idea of NATO membership, territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia.\u00a0 What should Russia give up?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn\u2019t.\u00a0 If I were president, it would not have happened \u2014 absolutely would not have happened, and it didn\u2019t happen for four years.\u00a0\n\nIf you look at what has taken place, under President Bush, they lost a lot.\u00a0 Under President Obama, they lost Crimea.\u00a0 Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing.\u00a0 Under Trump, they lost nothing \u2014 Ukraine lost nothing.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t give up anything.\u00a0 And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot.\u00a0\n\nI think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they\u2019re in, it\u2019s got to be ended, and it\u2019s got to be stopped.\u00a0\n\nNow, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory, and they also have said from day one \u2014 long before President Putin, they\u2019ve said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO.\u00a0 They said that very strongly.\u00a0\n\nI actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war.\u00a0 And Biden said it, and Zelenskyy said it, and I think that was one of the reasons \u2014 one of the starts of the war.\u00a0\n\nBut from long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in, in any way, into NATO.\u00a0 And I start from that standpoint.\u00a0 I think everybody knew that.\u00a0\n\nNow, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they were able to make a deal where they can do that, that\u2019s fine with me.\u00a0 I really don\u2019t care.\u00a0 I want that bloodshed to stop.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see \u2014 you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we\u2019re talking about \u2014 the site of death.\u00a0 We\u2019re calling it the fields of death.\u00a0 We have a big ocean in between us.\u00a0 This is more important for Europe.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t be in \u2014 they have to equalize, and they\u2019re going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize.\u00a0\n\nBut as far as the negotiation, it\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t, and it\u2019s all dependent on what is going to happen.\u00a0 The negotiation really hasn\u2019t started.\u00a0\n\nBut I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I\u2019ve heard that Russia would never accept that, and I think Ukraine knew that, because Ukraine wasn\u2019t in and never requested to be in until more recently.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s the way it is, and I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to have to be.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, I \u2014\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Go ahead, please, with the tie.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nWith the tie, yeah.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, I have a question for the prime minister.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes, go ahead, please.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is Saurabh Shukla from NewsMobile.\u00a0 Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator.\u00a0 Who was a tougher negotiator today, and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes to tariffs with \u2014\u00a0\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Oh, he\u2019s a much tougher negotiator than me, and he\u2019s a much better negotiator than me.\u00a0 There\u2019s not even a contest.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nYeah, go ahead.\u00a0 Please go ahead.\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reena Bhardwaj from ANI.\u00a0 How do you see this relationship between the India and the United States to counter China?\u00a0 And what is your vision when it comes to India, you know, brokering peace in the Ukraine and Russia conflict?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think we are going to have a very good relationship with China.\u00a0 I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. \u00a0That was a bridge too far.\u00a0 But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well.\u00a0 We were very close, as leaders go.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close.\n\nAnd I think that China is a very important player in the world.\u00a0 I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia.\u00a0\n\nAnd I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on.\u00a0 If I could be of help, I\u2019d love to help, because that should be stopped.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for a long time, and it\u2019s quite violent.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite violent.\u00a0\n\nBut I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important.\u00a0\n\nYou know, the power of weaponry today is \u2014 and not only nuclear, but nuclear, in particular \u2014 the power of weaponry is very important.\u00a0 I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries.\u00a0 And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal, and we had the confines of a deal.\u00a0 We were \u2014 I thought we \u2014 he really wanted to do it and so did I \u2014 denuclearize.\u00a0 And it\u2019s such a beautiful term, when you think about it.\u00a0 In other words, to bring it down, because the power of those weapons is too great.\u00a0\n\nAnd I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response.\u00a0 He\u2019s building a very strong nuclear power.\u00a0 He\u2019s not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon.\u00a0 I mean, he\u2019ll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say.\u00a0\n\nBut it would be a great thing if we could \u2014 on a military basis, we\u2019re going to spend this year 900- \u2014 let\u2019s say $915 billion on military.\u00a0 Russia, without the war, was spending close to a hundred, but with the war, I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re spending, but they\u2019re spending a lot.\u00a0 And China is spending $400- and $450 billion.\u00a0 We\u2019re over $900 billion.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYou know, it doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWe\u2019re spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along.\u201d\u00a0 And I\u2019ll tell you, I think that something like that will happen.\u00a0\n\nFirst, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn\u2019t have Israel and the Middle East.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have October 7th \u2014 what a disaster \u2014 the disaster.\u00a0 Nothing was happening.\u00a0 Iran was not going to do anything, because Iran did not have much money at that point.\u00a0 They were broke.\u00a0 They were totally broke.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah.\u00a0 And you didn\u2019t have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened.\u00a0\n\nBut now I come back, and I have \u2014 the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the fires.\u00a0 But after I put out the fires, I\u2019m going to meet with China, and I\u2019m going to meet with Russia, and we\u2019re going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down \u2014 military \u2014 especially as it pertains to nuclear.\u00a0\n\nPlease.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And India\u2019s role \u2014 India\u2019s role in \u2014 how do \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you mentioned about American Islamic terrorism \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prime Minister, how do you see India play a role in a \u2014 in de-escalating the Ukraine-Russia \u2014\n\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 Mic, please.\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (No translation provided.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Prime Minister, how do you see India\u2019s role?\u00a0 You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0 I have also visited both countries.\u00a0 And many peoples are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral.\u00a0 I would like to clarify: India is not neutral.\u00a0 We have taken a side, and we have taken the side of peace.\u00a0\n\nAnd it is based on this principle of ours that, in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war.\u00a0 And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield.\u00a0 Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table, and India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present.\u00a0 It is only then that we will find a solution.\n\nThe efforts being made by President Trump \u2014 I support them, I welcome them, and I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Everybody, thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nAnd I very much appreciate the prime minister visiting our great country, and I do really appreciate it.\u00a0 We have so much in common, and all we want to do is have peace, and we want to have strength, and we want to have lots of different things together, but the relationship with India and with the prime minister has never been better.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 A great honor.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6:45 P.M.
