  "markdown": "[Fact Sheets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/)\n\n# \t\t\t\t\tOMB Q&amp;A Regarding Memorandum M-25-13\t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 28, 2025\n\nIn implementing President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders, OMB issued guidance requesting that agencies temporarily pause, to the extent permitted by law, grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that are implicated by the President\u2019s Executive Orders.\n\n**Any program not implicated by the President\u2019s Executive Orders is not subject to the****pause.**\n\nThe Executive Orders listed in the guidance are:\n\n*Protecting the American People Against Invasion*\n\n*Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid*\n\n*Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements*\n\n*Unleashing American Energy*\n\n*Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing*\n\n*Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth t*o*the Federal Government*\n\n*Enforcing the Hyde Amendment*\n\nAny program that provides direct benefits to individuals is not subject to the pause.\n\nThe guidance establishes a process for agencies to work with OMB to determine quickly whether any program is inconsistent with the President\u2019s Executive Orders. A pause could be as short as day. In fact, OMB has worked with agencies and has already approved many programs to continue even before the pause has gone into effect.\n\nAny payment required by law to be paid will be paid without interruption or delay.\n\n**Q: Is this a freeze on all Federal financial assistance?**\n\nA: No, the pause does not apply across-the-board. It is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities implicated by the President\u2019s Executive Orders, such as ending DEI, the green new deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that undermine the national interest.\n\n**Q: Is this a freeze on benefits to Americans like SNAP or student loans?**\n\nA: No, any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process. In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause.Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused. If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President\u2019s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments.\n\n**Q: Is the pause of federal financial assistance an impoundment?**\n\n**A:**No, it is not an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. It is a temporary pause to give agencies time to ensure that financial assistance conforms to the policies set out in the President\u2019s Executive Orders, to the extent permitted by law. Temporary pauses are a necessary part of program implementation that have been ordered by past presidents to ensure that programs are being executed and funds spent in accordance with a new President\u2019s policies and do not constitute impoundments.\n\n**Q: Why was this pause necessary?**\n\n**A:**To act as faithful stewards of taxpayer money, new administrations must review federal programs to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President\u2019s policies.\n",
  "summary": "On January 28, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum in relation to a set of Executive Orders from President Trump. The guidance requests federal agencies to temporarily pause funding for grant, loan, or financial assistance programs that are implicated by these Executive Orders. This pause is not applicable to programs that are directly beneficial to individuals or not associated with the President\u2019s directives. Some Executive Orders involved include reshaping foreign aid, prioritizing American energy, and ending government programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. \n\nThe document clarifies that this pause is not a blanket freeze on federal assistance. It specifically excludes direct benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP, among others. Such programs are essential to citizens and are exempt from this temporary halt. The memorandum outlines a procedure whereby agencies collaborate with the OMB to assess and quickly resolve potential conflicts with the Executive Orders. This ensures continuity of programs not directly affected by the Orders and avoids any delay in lawful payments.\n\nThe pause is described as a tool to align federal spending with the new administration's policies, rather than an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. The guidance aims to ensure tax dollars are managed in alignment with the new policy direction and law. Such measures have been utilized by past administrations during transitions in presidential policies.",
