  "summary": "The website page outlines various presidential actions taken on January 20, 2025. These actions cover a range of policy areas including election interference, accountability in the federal workforce, international relations, and economic policies. One significant action is holding former government officials accountable for election interference and improper disclosure of sensitive information, signaling a focus on safeguarding democratic processes. Additionally, the administration addressed the influence of foreign-controlled applications like TikTok under the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nOther actions include the United States' withdrawal from the World Health Organization, implementation of policy measures to prioritize American interests in international environmental agreements, and delivering emergency relief to address the cost-of-living crisis affecting American families. The administration also announced administrative freezes, such as a hiring freeze and a regulatory freeze pending review, and emphasized returning to in-person work to enhance operational efficiency in the government. Granting pardons related to the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, was noted as a contentious move aimed at addressing legal outcomes of those incidents.",
  "eli5": "The president made a lot of decisions on January 20, 2025, like punishing people for breaking election rules, stopping new hiring, leaving the World Health Organization, and helping people save money on living costs. They also want everyone to start working at the office again.",
