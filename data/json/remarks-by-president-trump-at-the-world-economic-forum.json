EST  \n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, Klaus.\u00a0 And hello to everyone in beautiful Davos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This has been a truly historic week in the United States.\u00a0 Three days ago, I took the oath of office, and we began the golden age of America.\u00a0 The recent presidential election was won by millions of votes and all seven \u2014 every one of them \u2014 all seven swing states.\u00a0 It was a massive mandate from the American people like hasn\u2019t been seen in many years.\u00a0 And some of the political pundits, even some of my so-called enemies, said it was the most consequential election victory in 129 years.\u00a0 That\u2019s quite nice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense.\u00a0 Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier, and more united than ever before, and the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we\u2019re doing and going to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My administration is acting with unprecedented speed to fix the disasters we\u2019ve inherited from a totally inept group of people and to solve every single crisis facing our country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration.\u00a0 Over the past four years, our government racked up $8 trillion in wasteful deficit spending and inflicted nation-wrecking energy restrictions, crippling regulations, and hidden taxes like never before.\u00a0 The result is the worst inflation crisis in modern history and sky-high interest rates for our citizens and even throughout the world.\u00a0 Food prices and the price of almost every other thing known to mankind went through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Biden totally lost control of what was going on in our country but, in particular, with our high-inflation economy and at our border.\u00a0 Because of these ruinous policies, total government spending this year is $1.5 trillion higher than was projected to occur when I left office just four years ago.\u00a0 Likewise, the cost of servicing the debt is more than 230 percent higher than was projected in 2020.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The inflation rate we are inheriting remains 50 percent higher than the historic target.\u00a0 It was the highest inflation probably in the history of our country.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, from the moment I took office, I\u2019ve taken rapid action to reverse each and every one of these radical left policies that created this calamity \u2014 in particular, with immigration, crime, and inflation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On day one, I signed an executive order directing every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and reduce the cost of daily life.\u00a0 I imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze, and I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Deal \u2014 I call it the \u201cGreen New Scam\u201d; withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord; and ended the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to let people buy the car they want to buy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I declared a national em- \u2014 energy emergency \u2014 and it\u2019s so important \u2014 national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet and pave the way for rapid approvals of new energy infrastructure.\u00a0 The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we\u2019re going to use it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it will make the United States a manufacturing superpower and the world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history, far exceeding even the record-setting efforts of my last term.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulatory costs on the average American household over the last four years.\u00a0 I have promised to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To further unleash our economy, our majorities in the House and Senate \u2014 which we also took, along with the presidency \u2014 are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, as you probably know by just reading any paper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing them down very substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts.\u00a0 But if you don\u2019t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff \u2014 differing amounts, but a tariff \u2014 which will direct hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars into our Treasury to strengthen our economy and pay down debt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Trump administration, there will be no better place on Earth to create jobs, build factories, or grow a company than right here in the good old USA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Already, American\u2019s economic \u2014 and you can see this, I think, maybe even in your \u2014 in your wonderful, wonderful room that you\u2019re all gathered together \u2014 so many of my friends \u2014 but, Americans, the economic confidence is soaring like we haven\u2019t seen in many, many decades, maybe not at all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon my election, it was just announced that small-business optimism skyrocketed by 41 points in a single month.\u00a0 That\u2019s the highest ever.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SoftBank has announced between a $100 and $200 billion investment in the U.S. economy because of the election result.\u00a0 And just two days ago, Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.\u00a0 Other companies, likewise, have announced billions and billions and billions \u2014 adding up to trillions \u2014 of investment in America, in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s also reported today in the papers that Saudi Arabia will be investing at least $600 billion in America.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll be asking the crown prince, who\u2019s a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion.\u00a0 I think they\u2019ll do that because we\u2019ve been very good to them.\u00a0 And I\u2019m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.\u00a0 You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t do before the election.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t show a lot of love by them not doing it.\u00a0 I was a little surprised by that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately.\u00a0 Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.\u00a0 You got to bring down the oil price; you\u2019re going to end that war.\u00a0 They should have done it long ago.\u00a0 They\u2019re very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what\u2019s taking place \u2014 millions of lives are being lost.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With oil prices going down, I\u2019ll demand that interest rates drop immediately.\u00a0 And, likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\u00a0 Interest rates should follow us.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All over, the progress that you\u2019re seeing is happening because of our historic victory in a recent presidential election, one that has become quite well known throughout the world.\u00a0\n\nI think a lot of things are happening to a lot of countries.\u00a0 They say that there\u2019s light shining all over the world since the election.\u00a0 And even countries that we aren\u2019t particularly friendly with are happy because they understand what \u2014 there is a future and th- \u2014 how great the future will be.\n\nUnder our leadership, America is back and open for business.\u00a0 And this week, I\u2019m also taking swift action to stop the invasion at our southern border.\u00a0 They allowed people to come in at levels that nobody has ever seen before.\u00a0 It was ridiculous.\u00a0 I decided a \u2014 and declared to dec- \u2014 to \u2014 to do \u2014 and very, very importantly \u2014 a national emergency on our border; immediately halted all entry of illegal border crossers, of which there were many; and began properly returning the illegal trespassers back to the place from which they came.\u00a0\n\nThat action, as you\u2019ve probably seen, has already started very strongly.\u00a0 I have deployed active-duty U.S. military and National Guard troops to the border to assist in repelling the invasion.\u00a0 It was really an invasion.\u00a0 We will not allow our territory to be violated.\u00a0\n\nAfter four long years, the United States is strong and sovereign and a beautiful nation once again. It\u2019s a strong, sovereign nation.\n\nIn addition, I\u2019m pleased to report that America is also a free nation once again.\u00a0 On day one, I signed an executive order to stop all government censorship.\u00a0 No longer will our government label the speech of our own citizens as misinformation or disinformation, which are the favorite words of censors and those who wish to stop the free exchange of ideas and, frankly, progress.\u00a0 We have saved free speech in America, and we\u2019ve saved it strongly.\n\nWith another historic executive order this week, I also ended the weaponization of law enforcement against the American people \u2014 and, frankly, against politicians \u2014 and restored the fair, equal, and impartial rule of law.\u00a0\n\nMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense \u2014 and these are policies that were absolute nonsense \u2014 throughout the government and the private sector.\u00a0 With the recent, yet somewhat unexpected, great Supreme Court decision just made, America will once again become a merit-based country.\u00a0 You have to hear that word: merit-based country.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019ve made it official \u2014 an official policy of the United States that there are only two genders, male and female, and we will have no men participating in women\u2019s sports, and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\u00a0\n\nFinally, as we restore common sense in America, we\u2019re moving quickly to bring back strength and peace and stability abroad.\u00a0 I\u2019m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago \u2014 it was only at 2 percent, and most nations didn\u2019t pay until I came along; I insisted that they pay, and they did \u2014 because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it\u2019s \u2014 it was unfair to the United States.\u00a0 But many, many things have been unfair for many years to the United States.\u00a0\n\nBefore even taking office, my team negotiated a ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, which wouldn\u2019t have happened without us, as I think most of the people in the room know.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the hostages began to return to their families.\u00a0 They are returning, and it\u2019s a beautiful sight.\u00a0 And they\u2019ll be coming in more and more.\u00a0 They started coming back on Sunday.\n\nOur efforts to secure a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine are now, hopefully, underway.\u00a0 It\u2019s so important to get that done.\u00a0 That is an absolute killing field.\u00a0\n\nMillions of soldiers are being killed.\u00a0 Nobody has seen anything like it since World War II.\u00a0 They\u2019re laying dead all over the flat fields.\u00a0 It\u2019s a flat field \u2014 farmland, and there\u2019s millions of Russians and millions of Ukrainians.\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s seen anything like it since World War II.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to end it.\u00a0\n\nAnd here in America, we have big events coming up.\u00a0 Next year we have the 250th anniversary of America\u2019s founding.\u00a0 I\u2019m so honored to be president during that.\u00a0 That\u2019s been a big event.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been talking about it for 10 years.\u00a0 We also have the World Cup, and I understand Gianni \u2014 Gianni is in the room \u2014 Infantino.\u00a0 He was very instrumental in helping us get it \u2014 he\u2019s there with you someplace, I think \u2014 and I want to thank him for that.\u00a0\n\nAnd then we have the Olympics coming up, which I was instrumental in getting, also, in my first term.\u00a0 And who would have known that by skipping a term, I would get the Olympics?\u00a0 I was upset.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, I got the Olympics to come and I won\u2019t be president.\u201d\u00a0 But it turned out, through a stroke of luck or whatever you might call it, that I\u2019m going to be president during the World Cup and the Olympics and the 250th\n\nanniversary.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s going to be three big events.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve accomplished more in less than four days \u2014 we have really been working \u2014 four days \u2014 than other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 It\u2019s really an amazing thing to see, and the spirit and the light over our country has been incredible.\u00a0\n\nUnder the last administration, our nation has suffered greatly, but we are going to bring it back and make it greater, bigger, stronger, better than ever before.\u00a0\n\nI want to thank everybody for being with you.\u00a0 I would have been there myself, except the inauguration was two days ago.\u00a0 I thought it might be a little bit quick to make it the first stop, but we\u2019ll get there one day.\u00a0 We hope to get there.\u00a0\n\nBut I \u2014 I do appreciate \u2014 I heard the audience is fantastic, and many of my friends are in the audience.\u00a0 And I will be taking questions now from some very distinguished people.\u00a0\n\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr.\u00a0 President, for that very powerful speech, and I think you could hear the applause all the way from Davos to the White House.\u00a0 But next year, it will be even better, because then you can get the applause here in Davos.\u00a0 So, we wish you welcome to our village next year.\u00a0 We hope to see you.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 So, we also know, Mr. President, that you open up for interaction here.\u00a0 We have a great panel with some of the most distinguished businesspeople in the world.\u00a0\n\nLet me start with someone that you know really well, that I think is almost a neighbor of you in Mal-a- \u2014 in \u2014 in Florida, Mr. Steve Schwarzman, chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone Group.\u00a0\n\nSo, Steve, floor is yours.\n\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:\u00a0 Well, Mr. President \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, Steve.\u00a0\n\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:\u00a0 \u2014 I\u2019m sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I hope so.\n\nMR. SCHWARZMAN:\u00a0 You\u2019ve had the busiest four days that anybody can imagine, and congratulations for that.\u00a0\n\nAnd my question is \u2014 is about some of the things I\u2019ve observed here at Davos.\u00a0 It\u2019s a terrific forum.\u00a0 I\u2019ve met lots of people, as usual.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve been here 30 years.\u00a0 And a lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU, and they attribute slower growth rates here because of numerous factors, but especially because of regulations.\u00a0\n\nAnd you\u2019ve taken a completely different approach in this area.\u00a0 And if you could explain the theory of what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re going to do it, and what you expect the outcome to be, I\u2019d appreciate it.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 And congratulations, Steve \u2014 you\u2019re a friend of mine \u2014 but on a great career.\u00a0 You have had an amazing career and continues.\u00a0 So, I just want to congratulate you.\u00a0 Very inspirational to a lot of people.\u00a0\n\nI want to talk about the EU, because you mentioned specifically that I\u2019ve also had a lot of friends and leaders of countries.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten to know them all my first term and a little bit during this period of four years and know them well, like them a lot, but they\u2019re very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved \u2014 environmental impact statements for things that you shouldn\u2019t even have to do that, and many, many other ways that it takes.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to give you a quick little example.\u00a0 I w- \u2014 in the private life, my beautiful private life \u2014 before I had all these things happening \u2014 the world is a little different \u2014 I had a nice, simple life.\u00a0 You knew that.\u00a0\n\nBut when I had that simple life, I did projects, and I had a big project in Ireland, and it had to get approval on something that would have made it even better.\u00a0 And I got the approval from Ireland in a period of a week, and it was a very, very, very efficient, good approval.\u00a0\n\nAnd they informed me, though, \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re going to have to get it from the EU, and we think that\u2019ll take five to six years.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d\u00a0 And this was before politics.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cWait a minute.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that important.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to go five or six years.\u201d\u00a0 But it would have been a big investment.\u00a0 It would have been nice, and it would have been good for the project.\u00a0\n\nAnd I sent the people to the EU to see if they could speed it up, and basically it was a five- or six-year wait just to get a simple approval that Ireland gave me in a period of, literally, not much more than a week.\u00a0\n\nAnd I realized right then \u2014 that was the first time I really was involved with the EU, but I realized right then, that\u2019s a problem, and I didn\u2019t even bother applying to do it, and \u2014 or if I did, I pulled it very quickly.\u00a0 I don\u2019t wa- \u2014 I have to be very accurate, because I don\u2019t want to be criticized.\u00a0 \u201cHe did apply, actually.\u201d\u00a0 No, I want to be very accurate.\u00a0 So, I don\u2019t think I did, but if I did, I pulled it very quickly.\u00a0 It was just something you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t wait five years or six years to get an approval.\u00a0\n\nSo, a lot of \u2014 in a very big business sense, a lot of people are \u2014 are claiming that\u2019s the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly.\u00a0 They have a large tax that we know about and \u2014 a VAT tax \u2014 and it\u2019s a very substantial one.\u00a0 They don\u2019t take our far- \u2014 essentially, don\u2019t take our farm products and they don\u2019t take our cars.\u00a0 Yet, they send cars to us by the millions.\n\nThey put tariffs on things that we want to do, like, for instance, I think they actually \u2014 in terms of these are noneconomic or nonmonetary tariffs, and \u2014 and those are very bad, and they make it very difficult to bring products into Europe, and yet they expect to be selling and they do sell their products in the United States.\u00a0\n\nSo, we have, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits with the EU, and nobody is happy with it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to do something about it, but nobody is happy with it.\u00a0 So, I think the EU has to speed up their process.\u00a0\n\nFriends of mine that are in some of the nations within the EU, great people, they \u2014 they want to be able to compete better, and you can\u2019t compete when you can\u2019t get \u2014 go through the approval process fast.\u00a0 There\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t go faster.\u00a0\n\nSo, you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m trying to be constructive, because I love Europe.\u00a0 I love the countries of Europe.\u00a0 But the process is a very cumbersome one, and th- \u2014 and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose.\n\nOne other \u2014 just to finish up, I got a call from the head of a major airline, one of the biggest airlines in the world.\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, could you help us?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cLanding in Europe is brutal.\u00a0 They charge us fees for everything, and it\u2019s so unfair.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cHow does it compare to China?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s much worse.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd the other thing, as you know, they took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case.\u00a0 They won $15 or $16 billion from Apple.\u00a0 They won billions from Google.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions.\u00a0\n\nThese are American companies.\u00a0 Whether you like them or not, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that.\u00a0 And that\u2019s \u2014 as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation.\u00a0\n\nSo, we have some very big complaints with the EU.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Tha- \u2014 thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now go to one of your friends in the EU, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9.\u00a0 He\u2019s the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I guess you have a question ready, Patrick, for the president.\n\nMR. POUYANN\u00c9:\u00a0 Mr. President, as we understand, energy is at the top of your agenda, and it\u2019s an honor for me to represent the energy industry tonight in this panel.\u00a0 TotalEnergies is indeed the fourth largest oil and gas and electricity company in the world.\u00a0\n\nI will not ask you a question about the oil price.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite clear what you expect from us.\u00a0 I will more go to gas more.\u00a0 And we, our company, is the largest, number one exporter LNG from the U.S. company.\u00a0 We are a strong contributor to and we invest in mammoth LNG projects in Texas, $20 billion.\u00a0 It\u2019s far from $200, but it\u2019s $20 billion.\u00a0 And we contribute with that to security of supply to Europe as we export this LNG to Europe.\u00a0\n\nSome experts fear that if there are too many projects developed in the U.S. on LNG, this could have an inflat- \u2014 inflationary impact on the U.S. domestic gas price, and they recommend a pause on these projects.\u00a0\n\nI would ask you the following question: What are your views on \u2014 about such a pause on investments on LNG in the U.S.?\u00a0 What would happen if you would observe an increased domestic gas price because of these exports?\u00a0 And final question, which is important for Europe: Would you agree to guarantee security of supplies of U.S. LNG to Europe?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, on the last part of your question, yes, I would.\u00a0 I would make sure that you get it.\u00a0 If we make a deal, we make a deal; you\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 Because a lot of people do have that problem.\u00a0 They make a deal, and then it can\u2019t get supplied because of war-type problems and other problems.\u00a0 So, we would absolutely do that.\u00a0\n\nLNG is very interesting, because when I took office for the first term, one of the first things I looked at was two \u2014 there were two very massive plants in Louisiana, a state that has been very good to me.\u00a0 I won it by many, many points, and\n\nI felt strongly indebted to it, actually.\u00a0\n\nAnd they said there are two plants that have been under environmental consideration for more than 10 years, and they were costing \u2014 as you say, you know how expensive those plants are \u2014 but they were costing like $12 billion and, I think, $14 or $15 billion.\u00a0 But they couldn\u2019t get their permits.\u00a0 It was \u2014 they were in review for years \u2014 many, many years \u2014 like a decade or more.\u00a0\n\nAnd I said, \u201cSo ridiculous.\u201d\u00a0 I know so much about that, because in the construction industry, I had to go through it too, but I got good at it after a while.\u00a0\n\nBut I \u2014 I went \u2014 I saw the projects, and you\u2019re talking about a total investment of $25 to $30 billion, and it looked like it was going to end.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t get their permits, and I got them done in less than a week.\u00a0 It was done, completed.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, when they called them to announce that it was done, the countries \u2014 largely countries \u2014 Japan was involved and \u2014 and another country and some very big investors \u2014 they couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 They actually couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0\n\nAnd I said, \u201cJust do yourself one favor.\u00a0 Don\u2019t pay any consultants, because the only one that got it done was me.\u201d \u00a0I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and for the world, but the consultants had nothing to do with it, you know?\u00a0 The consultants go in and they say, \u201cGive us millions of dollars because Trump did it.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody called me about it.\u00a0 I just heard it was a problem for years, and I got it done because it was the right thing to do for the U.S. and the right thing to do for beyond.\u00a0 It had to do with energy \u2014 very important.\u00a0\n\nSo, I think it\u2019s very important.\u00a0 I think the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, I disagree with one.\u00a0 I think the more that you do, the lower the price is going to go.\u00a0 And what I\u2019d like to see is rapid approvals.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to give very rapid approvals in the United States, like with the AI plants, talking to \u2014 many people want to build them.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be a very big thing.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to build electric generating facilities \u2014 they are going to build.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to get them the approval.\u00a0 Under emergency declaration, I can get the approvals done myself without having to go through years of waiting.\u00a0\n\nAnd the big problem is we need double the energy we currently have in the United States \u2014 can you imagine? \u2014 for AI to really be as big as we want to have it.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s a very competitive \u2014 it will be very competitive with China and others.\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to give emergency declarations so that they can start building them almost immediately.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I think it was largely my idea, because nobody thought this was possible.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t that they were not smart, because they\u2019re the smartest, but I told them that what I want you to do is build your electric generating plant right next to your plant as a separate building, connected.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re kidding.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to hook into the grid, which is old and, you know, could be taken out.\u00a0 If it\u2019s taken out, they wouldn\u2019t have any way to get any electricity.\u00a0\n\nSo, we are going to allow them to go on a very rapid bas- \u2014 basis to build their plant \u2014 build the electric generating plant.\u00a0 They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup.\u00a0 Good, clean coal.\u00a0\n\nYou know, if there were a problem with a \u2014 with a pipe coming in \u2014 as an example, you\u2019re going with gas \u2014 oil or gas \u2014 and a pipe gets blown up or, for some reason, doesn\u2019t work, there are some companies in the U.S. that have coal sitting right by the plant so that if there\u2019s an emergency, they can go to that short-term basis and use our very clean coal.\u00a0\n\nSo, that\u2019s something else that a lot of people didn\u2019t even know about.\u00a0 But nothing can destroy coal \u2014 not the weather, not a bomb \u2014 nothing.\u00a0 It might make it a little smaller, might make it a little different shape.\u00a0 But coal is very strong as a backup.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great backup to have that facility, and it wouldn\u2019t cost much more \u2014 more money.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have more coal than anybody.\u00a0 We also have more oil and gas than anybody.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to make it so that the plants will have their own electric generating facilities attached right to their plant.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have to worry about a utility.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to get very rapid approvals.\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. President.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now go to another CEO that you know very well: Brian Moynihan, the CEO and chair of Bank of America.\n\nMR. MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Good afternoon, Mr. President, and congratulations \u2014 an obviously eventful week for you and your family.\u00a0\n\nIf you remember, five years ago, you came here and we walked among 150 CEOs from all over the world, and you engaged with them about your policies and your procedures.\n\nThis year, you\u2019re not here.\u00a0 And yet this week was eventful, from the orders that you mentioned earlier \u2014 literally a wave of orders coming out on immigration, on trade, and many other matters.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, as a representative of the United States here,\n\nwe got a lot of questions about what does all this mean and how would the president square this with his clear focus on growth, prosperity, market gro- \u2014 stock market growth, a good bond market, and bringing down prices.\u00a0\n\nSo, how do you think about the impact of all these orders and how fast they come out and how you\u2019re going to balance them with that scorecard of being successful on both contan- \u2014 continuing GDP growth, bringing down inflation, and also having a good stock price appreciation for the American citizen?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it\u2019s going to actually bring down inflation.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to bring up jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a lot of jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a lot of companies moving in.\u00a0\n\nYou know, Brian, we\u2019re at 21 percent.\u00a0 It was at 40 percent, and I got it down to 21 percent \u2014 the corporate tax.\u00a0 And it was \u2014 actually, if you look at state and city, it was, in many cases, much higher than 40 percent.\u00a0 I got it down to 21 percent.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re going to bring it down from 21 to 15 percent if \u2014 this is a big \u201cif\u201d \u2014 if you make your product in the U.S.\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to have the lowest \u2014 just about the lowest rate.\u00a0 It will be \u2014 the 21 is on the low side worldwide; the 15 is about as low as it gets, and by far the lowest of a large country \u2014 a large, you know, rich, powerful country \u2014 by far, not even a contest.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to bring it down to 15 percent if you make your product in the USA.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s going to create a \u2014 a tremendous buzz.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re also probably going back to the one-year deduction, where we deduct \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we did that originally, and that was amazing what \u2014 the impact that that had, the one-year deduction, which built up over a period of time and then it expires.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to go back to that when we do the renewal of the Trump tax plan.\u00a0\n\nWe have to get Democrats to approve it.\u00a0 But, you know, if the Democrats didn\u2019t approve it, I don\u2019t know how they can survive with about a 45 percent tax increase, because that\u2019s what it would be.\u00a0 And so, I think they\u2019re going to b- \u2014 w- \u2014 we\u2019ve been working along with them pretty well.\u00a0\n\nI think it\u2019s very hard for a political group to say, \u201cLet\u2019s charge people 45 percent more.\u201d\u00a0 So, I think we\u2019re in good shape.\n\nBut we\u2019re actually doing a reduction for business and small businesses, where you\u2019re going to b- \u2014 bring it down to 15 percent, which is really something.\u00a0\n\nAnd, by the way, speaking of you \u2014 and you\u2019ve done a fantastic job \u2014 but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America.\u00a0 This conserve- \u2014 they don\u2019t take conservative business.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you\u2019re going to open your banks to conservatives, because what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. BRENDE:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 \u2014 I\u2019ll say that your friend Gianni was \u2014 said hello \u2014 told me tell you hello, and we look forward to sponsoring the World Cup when it comes, both this summer for the club and next year.\u00a0 So, thank you for getting that for the United States.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Brian.\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 We\u2019ll now go to Ana Bot\u00edn.\u00a0 She\u2019s the executive chairman of Banco Santander, one of the big European banks and also in the U.S.\u00a0\n\nSo, Ana.\n\nMS. BOT\u00cdN:\u00a0 Mr. President, congratulations on a historic victory.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nMS. BOT\u00cdN:\u00a0 I believe you don\u2019t know me as well as my fellow panelists, so a few words.\u00a0 Santander is one of the largest banks in the world by number of customers, 170 million.\u00a0 That\u2019s more than my friend Brian or my friend Jamie have.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\n\nMS. BOT\u00cdN:\u00a0 And those \u2014 (applause) \u2014\n\nMR. MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 If they fix the regulation (inaudible).\n\nMS. BOT\u00cdN:\u00a0 That\u2019s coming.\u00a0 That\u2019s coming.\u00a0\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 That was cheeky.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMS. BOT\u00cdN:\u00a0 We are \u2014 we are a big investor in the United States.\u00a0 We have many million customer, 12,000 employees.\u00a0 We\u2019re one of the largest auto lenders, and we recently launched a fully digital bank called Openbank.\u00a0\n\nWe strongly believe banks have a pivotal role in the economy, and we can accelerate growth and help many more customers.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we do in the United States.\u00a0 So, as Brian pointed out, we very much welcome your focus on deregulation and reducing bureaucracy.\u00a0\n\nSo, my question is: What are your priorities in this regard, and how fast is this going to happen?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s going to \u2014 thank you and congratulations.\u00a0 I know very much about your bank, and you\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0\n\nWe are going to move very quickly.\u00a0 We\u2019ve moved very quickly.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done things in the last three days that nobody thought were possible to do in years.\u00a0 And it\u2019s all taken \u2014 it\u2019s all taken effect.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to have a huge impact on the economy, a huge positive impact.\u00a0 Money was being wasted on crazy things.\u00a0\n\nI mean, the Green New Deal was such a total disgrace \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014 how that was perpetrated.\u00a0 And it was conceived of by people that were average students \u2014 less than average students, I might add \u2014 and never even took a course in energy or the environment.\u00a0 It was just a game.\u00a0 Remember, the world was going to end in 12 years?\u00a0 Remember that?\u00a0 Well, the 12 years has come and gone.\u00a0 It was going to end.\u00a0 It was going to all foam into earth.\u00a0 But, you know, the time has come.\n\nThe \u2014 these people \u2014 and they \u2014 they really \u2014 they really scared the Democrats large- \u2014 I can\u2019t say the Republicans.\u00a0 Republicans maybe could have fought harder to stop it, but it\u2019s been a tremendous waste of \u2014 a tremendous waste of money.\u00a0\n\nYou know, during my four years, we had the cleanest air, we had the cleanest water, and yet we had the most productive economy in the history of our country.\u00a0 We had the most productive economy.\u00a0 Until COVID came, we had the most productive in the history of our country, by far.\u00a0\n\nAnd \u2014 and actually, you could look worldwide, we \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we were beating everybody from China to everybody else.\u00a0 So \u2014 and we think we really \u2014 now, with what we have learned and all of the other things that have taken place, we think we can even far surpass that \u2014 a- \u2014 actually, far, far surpass it.\u00a0 But we do \u2014 one thing we\u2019re going to be demanding is we\u2019re going to \u2014 be demanding respect from other nations.\u00a0\n\nCanada.\u00a0 We have a tremendous deficit with Canada.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to have that anymore.\u00a0 We can\u2019t do it.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good for them.\u00a0 As you probably know, I say, \u201cYou can always become a state, and if you\u2019re a state, we won\u2019t have a deficit. \u00a0We won\u2019t have to tariff you, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut Canada has been very tough to deal with over the years, and it\u2019s not fair that we should have a $200 billion or $250 billion deficit.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need them to make our cars, and they make a lot of them.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their lumber because we have our own forests, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their oil and gas.\u00a0 We have our \u2014 we have more than anybody.\u00a0\n\nSo, you know, just as an example, with Mexico \u2014 we\u2019re dealing with Mexico, I think, very well.\u00a0 And we\u2019re just \u2014 you know, w- \u2014 we just want to be treated fairly with other nations, because there\u2019s hardly a nation in the world \u2014 and I blame this on us, and I blame it on politicians that for some reason \u2014 and probably mostly it\u2019s stupidity, but you could also say other reasons, but mostly stupidity \u2014 they\u2019ve allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S.\u00a0 And w- \u2014 we can\u2019t allow that to happen anymore.\u00a0\n\nYou know, we have debt.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very small debt when you compare it to value \u2014 the value of the assets that we have, but we don\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0 We want to just have debt be obliterated, and we\u2019ll be able to do that fairly rapidly.\u00a0 And a lot of good things are going to happen.\u00a0\n\nAnd \u2014 and honestly, good things are going to happen for the world, and good things are going to happen for the people that are dealing with us \u2014 allies and beyond allies.\u00a0\n\nOne thing \u2014 very important \u2014 I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon and get that war end \u2014 ended, and \u2014 and that\u2019s not from the standpoint of economy or anything else.\u00a0 It\u2019s from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted.\u00a0 Beautiful, young people are being shot in the battlefield.\u00a0 You know, the bullet \u2014 a very flat land, as I said, and the bullet goes \u2014 there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no hiding.\u00a0 And a bullet \u2014 the only thing going to stop the bullet is a human body.\u00a0 And you have to see \u2014 I\u2019ve seen pictures of what\u2019s taken place.\u00a0 It\u2019s a carnage.\u00a0\n\nAnd we really have to stop that war.\u00a0 That war is horrible.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not talking economy, I\u2019m not talking economics, I\u2019m not talking about natural resource.\u00a0 I\u2019m just talking about: There\u2019s so many young people being killed in this war, and that\u2019s not including the people that have been killed as the cities are being, you know, knocked down building by building.\u00a0 So, we really should get that stopped.\u00a0\n\nLikewise, in the Middle East, I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the Middle East, and I think that\u2019s going to \u2014 that\u2019s going to come along pretty well.\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 We know that most consequential relationship in the world is between the U.S. and China.\u00a0 U.S., 28 percent of the global economy; China close to 20.\u00a0 That\u2019s almost half of the global GDP.\u00a0\n\nAnd we know that you called President Xi Jinping last Friday.\u00a0 We heard that you had a good discussion.\u00a0\n\nHow do you see the relationship between the U.S. and China in the next four years under your leadership?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He called me.\u00a0 But I see it very good.\u00a0 I think that we\u2019re going to have a very good relationship.\u00a0 All we want is fairness.\u00a0 We just want a level playing field.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to take advantage.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been having massive deficits with China.\u00a0 Biden allowed it to get out of hand.\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 $1.1 trillion deficit.\u00a0 It\u2019s ridiculous, and it\u2019s just an unfair relationship.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have to make it just fair.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to make it phenomenal.\u00a0 We have to make it a fair relationship.\u00a0 Right now, it\u2019s not a fair relationship.\u00a0 The deficit is massive, as it is with other countries \u2014 a lot of Asian countries, actually.\u00a0 But we have deficits that are very big, and we can\u2019t keep doing that, so we\u2019re not going to keep doing that.\u00a0\n\nBut I like President Xi very much.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always liked him.\u00a0 We always had a very good relationship.\u00a0 It was very strained with COVID coming out of Wuhan.\u00a0 Obviously, that strained it.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it strained it with a lot of people, but that strained our relationship.\u00a0 But we always had a great relationship, I would say, and we look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully, China can help us stop the war with, in particular, Russia-Ukraine.\u00a0 And they have a great deal of power over that situation, and we\u2019ll work with them.\u00a0\n\nAnd I mentioned that with \u2014 during our phone conversation with President Xi, and hopefully we could work together and get that stopped.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019d like to see denuclearization.\u00a0 In fact, with President Putin, prior to a \u2014 an election result, which was, frankly, ridiculous, we were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along.\u00a0 China has a \u2014 a much smaller, right now, nuclear armament than us or field than us, but they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re going to be catching it at some point over the next four or five years.\u00a0\n\nAnd I will tell you that President Putin really liked the idea of \u2014 of cutting way back on nuclear.\u00a0 And I think the rest of the world, we would have gotten them to follow.\u00a0 And China would have come along too.\u00a0 China also liked it.\u00a0\n\nTremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we don\u2019t even want to talk about today, because you don\u2019t want to hear it.\u00a0 It\u2019s too depressing.\u00a0\n\nSo, we want to see if we can denuclearize, and I think that\u2019s very possible. \u00a0And I can tell you that President Putin wanted to do it.\u00a0 He and I wanted to do it.\u00a0 We had a good conversation with China.\u00a0 They would have been involved, and that would have been an unbelievable thing for the planet.\n\nAnd I hope \u2014\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Mr. President, when you\u2019re \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 it can be started up again.\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 \u2014 back here in Davos next year, will \u2014 will there be then a peace agreement with \u2014 with Ukraine and Russia by then?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019re going to have to ask Russia.\u00a0 Ukraine is ready to \u2014 to make a deal.\u00a0\n\nJust so you understand, this is a war that should have never started.\u00a0 If I were president, it would never have started.\u00a0 This is a war that should have never, ever been started.\u00a0 And \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t started during my \u2014 there was never even talk about it.\u00a0 I knew that it was the apple of President Putin\u2019s eye, but I also knew that there was no way he was going in, and he wasn\u2019t going to go in.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, when I was out, bad things happened, bad things were said, a lot of stupidity all around, and you end up with what you have.\u00a0 Now you have all these bombed-out cities \u2014 they look like demolition sites \u2014 with many people killed.\u00a0\n\nI think the \u2014 the thing that you\u2019ll see about Ukraine is that far \u2014 far more people have died than is being reported.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen that.\u00a0 But far, far more people have died.\n\nWhen you look at a city that\u2019s become a demolition site, where big buildings have been collapsed by missiles hitting them and everything else, and they say, \u201cOne person was slightly injured.\u201d\u00a0 No, no, many people were killed.\u00a0 Those are big buildings.\u00a0 I was surprised at how \u2014 that was my business.\u00a0 These are buildings that go two and three blocks long.\u00a0 They\u2019re 20 stories high.\u00a0 They\u2019re big, powerful buildings.\u00a0 Then they were knocked down, and there were a lot of people in those buildings.\u00a0 They had announced that two people were injured.\u00a0 That\u2019s not true.\u00a0 So, I think you\u2019re going to find that there were many more people killed in Ukraine and the Ukraine war than anybody has any idea.\u00a0\n\nBut if you look now, so many of the \u2014 the people being killed are soldiers just facing each other with guns, rifles, and drones \u2014 the new form of warfare \u2014 drones.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a very sad thing to see.\n\nAnd when you see pictures of the fields that I see, nobody wants to see it.\u00a0 You\u2019ll never be the same.\n\nMR. BRENDE:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 On behalf of all the 3,000 participants here in Davos, we really, really underline that joining us, the third day in your presidency, live, taking questions here, it\u2019s so appreciated.\u00a0 And we are already ready for receiving you next year in person.\u00a0\n\nSo, thank you very much, and all the best from Davos.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11:49 A.M.

  "summary": "On January 23, 2025, President Trump delivered remarks at the World Economic Forum via teleconference from the White House. During his speech, President Trump asserted the start of a new era in America following his recent electoral victory, which he described as historic and characterized by a wide margin of votes across all seven swing states. He criticized the previous administration's handling of the U.S. economy, citing excessive government spending and restrictive regulations as contributors to inflation and high interest rates. To address these issues, he outlined various initiatives taken in the early days of his new administration, such as reversing regulations, freezing government hiring, and establishing a Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTrump emphasized his administration's intention to reclaim America's status as a leading manufacturing and economic power. He detailed various actions aimed at reducing taxes and encouraging domestic production, including a commitment to broad deregulation and significant tax cuts. Additionally, he touched upon foreign policy matters, such as fostering better relationships with China and securing peace in conflict regions like the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Trump also hinted at changes in national policies on social issues and global trade, projecting confidence in his administration's ability to effect swift and meaningful changes.\n\nThe President addressed questions from business leaders regarding regulatory policies, energy production, and international trade. He promised to continue working towards reducing wasteful spending and emphasized restoring merit-based policies and sovereignty at the national border. Trump concluded with a hopeful outlook on international cooperation and the prospects of denuclearization and peace settlement efforts involving key players like President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia.",
