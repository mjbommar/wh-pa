grow the United States economy; and improve our trade relationships with trading partners to the benefit of American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. \u00a0Sec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to reduce our large and persistent annual trade deficit in goods and to address other unfair and unbalanced aspects of our trade with foreign trading partners. \u00a0In pursuit of this policy, I will introduce the \u201cFair and Reciprocal Plan\u201d(Plan). \u00a0Under the Plan, my Administration will work strenuously to counter non-reciprocal trading arrangements with trading partners by determining the equivalent of a reciprocal tariff with respect to each foreign trading partner. \u00a0This approach will be of comprehensive scope, examining non-reciprocal trade relationships with all United States trading partners, including any:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a) \u00a0tariffs imposed on United States products;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes imposed by our trading partners on United States businesses, workers, and consumers, including a value-added tax;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0costs to United States businesses, workers, and consumers arising from nontariff barriers or measures and unfair or harmful acts, policies, or practices, including subsidies, and burdensome regulatory requirements on United States businesses operating in other countries;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d) \u00a0policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate from their market value, to the detriment of Americans; wage suppression; and other mercantilist policies that make United States businesses and workers less competitive; and \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e) \u00a0any other practice that, in the judgment of the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, imposes any unfair limitation on market access or any structural impediment to fair competition with the market economy of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Plan shall ensure comprehensive fairness and balance across the international trading system by factoring in losses as a result of measures that disadvantage the United States as applied, regardless of what they are called or whether they are written or unwritten. \u00a0Sec. 3. \u00a0Taking Action. \u00a0(a) \u00a0After the submission of the specified agency reports due under the America First Trade Policy Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, and the heads of such other executive departments and agencies as the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative deem relevant, shall initiate, pursuant to their respective legal authorities, all necessary actions to investigate the harm to the United States from any non-reciprocal trade arrangements adopted by any trading partners. \u00a0Upon completion of such necessary actions, they shall submit to me a report detailing proposed remedies in pursuit of reciprocal trade relations with each trading partner.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall assess all fiscal impacts on the Federal Government and the impacts of any information collection requests on the public, and shall deliver an assessment in writing to the President.\u00a0Sec. 4. \u00a0Definitions. \u00a0For the purposes of this memorandum:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(a) \u00a0\u201cValue-added tax\u201d means a type of consumption tax that is levied on the incremental increase in value of a good or service at each stage of the supply chain.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0\u201cNontariff barrier\u201d or \u201cmeasure\u201d means any government-imposed measure or policy or nonmonetary barrier that restricts, prevents, or impedes international trade in goods, including import policies, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, government procurement, export subsidies, lack of intellectual property protection, digital trade barriers, and government-tolerated anticompetitive conduct of state-owned or private firms.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sec. 5. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i) \u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d) \u00a0The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\n",
  "summary": "The memorandum, dated February 13, 2025, addresses the issue of reciprocal trade and tariffs, directed by the President to various key economic officers, including the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce among others. The document emphasizes the need to balance the trade deficit and improve the economic standing of the United States by adjusting the current trade policies. It introduces the 'Fair and Reciprocal Plan,' aiming to ensure that trade arrangements with international partners are equitable and fair by examining tariff and non-tariff barriers. \n\nThe document notes that the U.S. currently has a large trade deficit and one of the most open economies with low tariffs compared to other major economies. The President's plan entails implementing reciprocal tariffs and addressing unfair and unbalanced trading practices to strengthen the U.S.' competitiveness globally. It calls for comprehensive evaluations and actions led by the relevant departments to remedy non-reciprocal trade practices detrimental to the American economy, seeking to enhance fairness on an international scale.",
