and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d)\u00a0 Any other act, policy, or practice of a foreign government that serves to undermine the global competitiveness of United States companies. \u00a0\n\nSec.\u00a03. \u00a0Agency Responsibilities. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The United States Trade Representative shall determine, in accordance with applicable law, whether to renew investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) of the DSTs of France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, which were initiated under my Administration on July 16, 2019, and June 5, 2020. \u00a0If the United States Trade Representative determines to renew such investigations, he shall take all appropriate and feasible action in response to those DSTs.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0The United States Trade Representative shall determine, consistent with section 302(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)) (section 302(b)), whether to investigate the DST of any other country that may discriminate against United States companies or burden or restrict United States commerce. \u00a0He shall further determine whether to pursue a panel under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the DST imposed by Canada and whether to investigate Canada\u2019s DST under section 302(b). \u00a0In making these determinations, the United States Trade Representative shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall jointly identify trade and other regulatory practices by other countries, including, without limitation, those described in section 2 of this memorandum, that discriminate against, disproportionately affect, or otherwise undermine the global competitiveness or intended operation of United States companies, in the digital economy and more generally, and recommend to me appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities.\u00a0 The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) (America First Trade Policy Memorandum).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative shall investigate whether any act, policy, or practice of any country in the European Union or the United Kingdom has the effect of requiring or incentivizing the use or development of United States companies\u2019 products or services in ways that undermine freedom of speech and political engagement or otherwise moderate content, and recommend appropriate actions to counter such practices under applicable authorities. \u00a0The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall determine whether any foreign country subjects United States citizens or companies, including, without limitation, in the digital economy, to discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes, or has any tax measure in place that otherwise undermines the global competitiveness of United States companies, is inconsistent with any tax treaty of the United States, or is otherwise actionable under section 891 of title 26, United States Code, or other tax-related legal authority.\u00a0 The Secretary of the Treasury shall include the results of this determination as part of the report required in section 2 of the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(f) \u00a0The United States Trade Representative shall identify tools the United States can use to secure among trading partners a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. \u00a0The United States Trade Representative shall include the results of this review as part of the report required in section 5(c) of the America First Trade Policy Memorandum.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(g) \u00a0The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing, shall establish a process that allows American businesses to report to the United States Trade Representative foreign tax or regulatory practices that disproportionately harm United States companies.Sec.\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0General Provisions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

  "summary": "# Summary\n\nOn February 21, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued addressing unfair financial impositions on American companies by foreign governments. The memorandum expresses concern over digital services taxes (DSTs) and other regulatory measures that have been enacted by several countries since 2019. These measures, which include taxes and restrictions on data flows and streaming services, target largely U.S. technology firms and often favor local businesses, thus harming American competitiveness and economic interests.\n\nThe policy outlined in the memorandum commits the U.S. administration to taking retaliatory measures such as tariffs if foreign governments continue with such discriminatory practices. Responsibilities are assigned to the United States Trade Representative, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, and other officials to evaluate and counter these foreign policies. This involves potentially renewing investigations into DSTs imposed by countries like France, Austria, and Italy, and identifying any tax or regulatory practices that undermine American businesses globally.\n",
