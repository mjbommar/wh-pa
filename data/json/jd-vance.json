Over time, many of those good jobs disappeared, and JD\u2019s family suffered the effects along with many others.\u00a0\n\nGrowing up, JD faced a challenging childhood marked by financial struggles and family instability. His mother\u2019s battle with addiction and his father\u2019s absence left a void that his grandparents filled with unwavering support and guidance. His grandma, Mamaw, who was the proud owner of 19 handguns, provided the tough love he needed to stay on the straight and narrow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter graduating from Middletown High School, JD served his country honorably by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, serving for four years with a tour in Iraq. Upon returning home, JD used the GI Bill to attend The Ohio State University, where he excelled academically and earned a spot at Yale Law School.\u00a0\n\nJD met his lovely wife, Usha, during their time in law school together. Today, they reside in Cincinnati, Ohio and are proud parents to three beautiful children. After law school, JD found success as an investor in startups across the Midwest, and as the author of the bestselling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d which gave a voice to millions of forgotten Americans across the heartland.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2022, JD Vance took his commitment to his country to the national stage and was elected to the U.S. Senate. As a Senator, he was a champion for issues such as securing our southern border, revitalizing American manufacturing, and fighting for the prosperity of working-class families across the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2024, President Donald J. Trump extended JD the incredible honor of asking him to serve as the Vice-Presidential Nominee for the Republican Party. JD looks forward to serving with President Trump over the next four years as they work diligently to Make America Great Again.\n\n[Learn more about Second Lady Usha Vance here.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-administration/usha-vance/)\n",
