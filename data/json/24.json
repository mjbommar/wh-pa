  "summary": "The page from the White House website provides a collection of links to different categories of documents including Articles, Briefings & Statements, Fact Sheets, Presidential Actions, and Remarks. Among these, it lists a series of Presidential Actions taken on January 20, and 21, 2025. These actions focus on various national and governmental topics such as protecting states from invasion, restoring merit to government service, and reforming federal hiring processes.\n\nThe President has issued directives to designate certain organizations as foreign terrorists, prioritize America-first policies, and establish a 'Department of Government Efficiency.' The aim is to enhance national security and efficiency within government operations. The document also touches upon various social policies, like ending certain government DEI programs and addressing gender ideology extremism, in an effort to align them with the administration's values.",
  "eli5": "The president has made some new rules to help make the government better at doing its job, and to keep the country safe from bad people. These rules also try to make sure everyone is treated fairly and follow the country's traditions.",
