of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Islamic Republic of Iran, Denying Iran All\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paths to a Nuclear Weapon, and Countering Iran\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Malign InfluenceAs President, my highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the United States and the American people.\u00a0 Since its inception in 1979 as a revolutionary theocracy, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has declared its hostility to the United States and its allies and partners.\u00a0 Iran remains the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror and has aided Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, the Taliban, al-Qa\u2019ida, and other terrorist networks.\u00a0 The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is itself a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.The Iranian Government, including the IRGC, is using agents and cyber-enabled means to target United States nationals living in the United States and other countries around the world for attacks, including assault, kidnapping, and murder.\u00a0 Iran has also directed its proxy groups, including Hezbollah\u2019s Islamic Jihad Organization, to embed sleeper cells in the Homeland to be activated in support of this terrorist activity. \u00a0\u00a0Iran bears responsibility for the horrific Hamas massacres committed on October 7, 2023, and bears responsibility for continued Houthi attacks against the United States Navy, allied navies, and international commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\u00a0 Since April 2024, the regime has twice demonstrated its willingness to launch ballistic and cruise missile attacks against the State of Israel.\u00a0Iran commits grievous human rights abuses and arbitrarily detains foreigners, including United States citizens, on spurious charges without due process of law, subjecting them to abuse.\u00a0 The United States stands with the women of Iran who face daily abuse by the regime.\u00a0Iran\u2019s nuclear program, including its enrichment- and reprocessing-related capabilities and nuclear-capable missiles, poses an existential danger to the United States and the entire civilized world.\u00a0 A radical regime like this can never be allowed to acquire or develop nuclear weapons, or to extort the United States or its allies through the threat of nuclear weapons acquisition, development, or use.\u00a0 Iran today stands in breach of its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations by concealing undeclared nuclear sites and material as required by its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\u00a0 Iran has obstructed IAEA access to its military sites or sites tied to the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, also known as SPND, and to interview nuclear weapons scientists still employed by SPND.\u00a0 Public reports indicating that Iran may now be engaged in computer modeling related to nuclear weapons development raise immediate alarm.\u00a0 We must deny Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon and end the regime\u2019s nuclear extortion racket.\u00a0Iran\u2019s behavior threatens the national interest of the United States.\u00a0 It is therefore in the national interest to impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime to end its nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program, and stop its support for terrorist groups.\u00a0Section 1. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0It is the policy of the United States that Iran be denied a nuclear weapon and intercontinental ballistic missiles; that Iran\u2019s network and campaign of regional aggression be neutralized; that the IRGC and its surrogates be disrupted, degraded, or denied access to the resources that sustain their destabilizing activities; and to counter Iran\u2019s aggressive development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities.\u00a0Sec. 2. \u00a0Enacting Maximum Pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran*.***(a) \u00a0The Secretary of the Treasury shall:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 immediately impose sanctions or appropriate

State shall:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 modify or rescind sanctions waivers, particularly those that provide Iran any degree of economic or financial relief,

of China;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (iii)\u00a0 lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Iran throughout the world, including within international organizations, including the denial of freedom of movement or safe haven to the IRGC or any terror proxy of Iran wherever such may operate outside Iran\u2019s borders; and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (iv)\u00a0\u00a0 take immediate steps, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant agencies, to ensure that the Iraqi financial system is not utilized by Iran for sanctions evasion or circumvention, and that Gulf countries are not used as sanctions evasion transshipment points.\u00a0(c) \u00a0The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations shall:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 work with key allies to complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (ii)\u00a0\u00a0 hold Iran accountable for its breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (iii)\u00a0 regularly convene the United Nations Security Council to highlight the myriad threats posed by Iran to international peace and security.\u00a0(d) \u00a0The Secretary of Commerce shall conduct a robust and continuous export control enforcement campaign to restrict the flow of technology and components used by the regime for military purposes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(e) \u00a0The Attorney General shall:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pursue all available legal steps to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute financial and logistical networks, operatives, or front groups inside the United States that are sponsored by Iran or an Iranian terror proxy;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (ii)\u00a0\u00a0 pursue all available legal steps to impound illicit Iranian oil cargoes;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (iii)\u00a0 pursue all available legal steps to identify Iranian governmental assets in the United States and overseas, and help American

indict and prosecute the leaders and members of Iranian-funded terrorist groups and proxies that have captured, harmed, or killed American citizens and, where possible and in coordination with the Secretary of State, seek their arrest and extradition to the United States; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (v)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0use all criminal, regulatory,

  "summary": "On February 4, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued to several key national security and economic officials, detailing the United States' strategy to impose maximum pressure on Iran. The memorandum underscores Iran's activities as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and accuses it of supporting various terrorist groups and committing human rights abuses. The memorandum reflects the administration's policy to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and to curtail its ballistic missile program, emphasizing the need to neutralize Iran's influence and aggression in the region.\n\nThe memorandum outlines directives for several departments and government agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with imposing sanctions and denying Iran and its proxies revenue. The Secretary of State is instructed to lead efforts to diplomatically isolate Iran and drive down its oil exports. Other roles include the UN Representative pushing for international sanctions, the Secretary of Commerce enforcing export controls, and the Attorney General taking legal action against Iranian networks. This comprehensive approach aims to disrupt Iran's malign activities and curb its nuclear ambitions.\n\nOverall, the memorandum serves as a detailed policy directive to various branches of the U.S. government, advocating for stringent measures to counteract Iran's perceived threats by applying a multi-faceted strategy involving diplomatic, economic, and legal tools.",
