  "summary": "In a further attempt to address the synthetic opioid crisis, the President of the United States issued an amendment on March 3, 2025, to Executive Order 14195, initially signed on February 1, 2025. The amendment acknowledges that the People's Republic of China has not taken satisfactory actions to curb the flow of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, into the United States, posing threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. As a response, the President modified existing tariffs, increasing the rate from 10 percent to 20 percent on certain Chinese products.\n\nThe document conveys the serious nature of the ongoing opioid crisis and the U.S. administration's reliance on economic measures to influence international cooperation, particularly from China. The directives are grounded in several legislative authorities, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and others, emphasizing a legal framework to justify these actions. While the order outlines significant policy steps, it clarifies it does not authorize the creation of legal rights enforceable by any party.",
