Trump unveiled a plan for fair, free, reciprocal trade as he makes clear to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate being ripped off.**The U.S. has one of the most open economies in the world, yet our trading partners keep their markets closed to U.S. exports \u2014 and reciprocal trade will finally correct that imbalance.\n\n**President Trump\u2019s plan to restore fairness and put American workers first was met with immediate praise:**\n\n[**Renewable Fuels Association:**](https://ethanolrfa.org/media-and-news/category/news-releases/article/2025/02/rfa-thanks-president-trump-for-taking-action-to-counter-brazil-ethanol-tariff)****\u201cFor almost a decade now, we have spent precious time and resources fighting back against an unfair and unjustified tariff regime imposed by Brazil\u2019s government on U.S. ethanol imports. What\u2019s more ironic is that these tariff barriers have been erected against U.S. ethanol imports while our country has openly accepted\u2014and even encouraged and incentivized\u2014ethanol imports from Brazil. As the two largest ethanol producers on the planet, we long enjoyed a cooperative free-trade relationship with Brazil involving ethanol, relying on each other when there were shortfalls or disruptions in the U.S. or Brazilian marketplace. However, that bilateral cooperation was abandoned by Brazil in 2017, when they instituted a tariff rate quota scheme, and eventually adopted a tariff in 2020. The Brazilian tariff on U.S. ethanol now stands at 18 percent and has virtually eliminated all market access for U.S. ethanol producers. We thank President Trump for taking this action and hope this reciprocal tariff will help encourage a return to free and fair ethanol trade relationship with Brazil.\u201d\n\n[**American Iron and Steel Institute:**](https://www.steel.org/2025/02/aisi-statement-on-president-trumps-memo-on-reciprocal-trade/) \u201cAISI applauds President Trump\u2019s action today ordering the development of a comprehensive plan for restoring fairness in U.S. trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements.\u00a0American steel producers know well the negative impact of foreign unfair trade practices, including subsidies, currency manipulation and other unfair and discriminatory policies and practices, on domestic industries and their workers \u2026 We look forward to working with the Secretary of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative and other key administration officials as they develop their plan of action to ensure reciprocity in international trade and to preserve the competitiveness of the American steel industry and other sectors.\u201d\n\n[**Growth Energy:**](https://growthenergy.org/2025/02/13/brazilian-trade-barriers/)****\u201cWhile American biofuel producers have been almost entirely blocked off from the Brazilian market, Brazilian producers have enjoyed unfettered access to the U.S. In some cases, certain policies in the U.S. even incentivize the use of imported Brazilian ethanol instead of ethanol produced here in the U.S. This runs contrary to putting America first, and is exactly why President Trump is taking steps to address this issue. Thank you, President Trump for taking action and pushing for a level playing field for American ethanol producers.\u201d\n\n[**Small Business Administration:**](https://x.com/SBAgov/status/1890148991288963525) \u201cPresident Trump is right: restoring a level playing field on trade will unlock the next blue collar boom \u2013 creating jobs and powering our economy through \u2018Made in America.\u2019 Huge news for Main Street!\u201d\n\n[**Energy Secretary Chris Wright:**](https://x.com/SecretaryWright/status/1890147412540637343)****\u201cPresident\u2019s Trump\u2019s \u2018Fair and Reciprocal Plan\u2019 on trade puts the American people first. As a former businessman, it\u2019s great to see our country being run like a business and fighting for fairness on trade\u2013 it\u2019s the American way!\u201d\n\n[**Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum:**](https://x.com/SecretaryBurgum/status/1890140996740030652)****\u201cPresident Trump is making America strong again. His Fair and Reciprocal Plan is commonsense: if you impose tariffs on us, we will impose tariffs on you in return.\u201d\n\n[**Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy:**](https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1890174374596301122)****\u201cBravo, President Trump! Thank you for announcing the Fair and Reciprocal Plan, which is based on legislation we worked on together in your first term. Unfair trade practices have hurt America\u2019s transportation and infrastructure sectors for too long. President Trump\u2019s trade plan will strengthen supply chains, boost infrastructure investments, and expand American transportation solutions. We promised a golden age of transportation, and I will not rest until America\u2019s transportation system is great again!\u201d\n\n[**Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner:**](https://x.com/SecretaryTurner/status/1890142679377613310)****\u201cFor too long Washington has put foreign interests above Americans \u2014 that ends today. @POTUS\u2019 Fair and Reciprocal Plan will put American workers on a level playing field.\u201d\n\n[**EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin:**](https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1890149078396539174)****\u201cThe American people elected @POTUS with a mandate to grow our economy and bring back American manufacturing. When it comes to Reciprocal tariffs, no one should ever underestimate President Trump\u2019s vision, long game, and determination to deliver the Great American Comeback.\u201d\n\n[**Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA):**](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1890120154488447207)****\u201cFor too long, foreign countries have exploited America through unfair trade practices. President Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs aim to confront these countries, protecting American workers and businesses through trade that is fair again. The Trump policies are focused on leveling the playing field and putting America FIRST.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN):**](https://x.com/SenatorBanks/status/1890125230523216292) \u201cThe globalist approach to trade threw our workers under a bus driven by their foreign competitors. President Trump\u2019s America First trade plan corrects this injustice that our industries and workers have faced for decades. The reciprocal tariffs announced today will bring back fairness and prosperity and stop Americans from being taken advantage of.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN):**](https://x.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1890111825192288655)****\u201cPresident Trump is putting American workers and farmers first. He will end unfair trade deals and prioritize goods made in America! With President Trump at the negotiating table, we are going to get the best possible deal.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):**](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1890131741232201839)****\u201cMost countries charge us far more in tariffs than we charge them. Those days are over. I applaud President Trump\u2019s decision to impose reciprocal tariffs against our trading partners. Whatever tariffs they put on American products, we will put on their products. This will be a game changer. Simple and brilliant.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS):**](https://x.com/RogerMarshallMD/status/1890131872979591306)****\u201cGone are the days of unfair trade deals that give foreign nations the upper hand. Today, President Trump put the world on notice: America will no longer be taken advantage of.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE):**](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/02/13/trumps-blanket-tariff-plan-praised-rust-belt-congressmen/amp/) \u201cThe average weighted tariff on foreign products coming into the U.S. is 1.5%, yet the average tariff on U.S. products globally is 6%. President Trump promised to bring those numbers closer to balance. These tariffs are a step toward accomplishing that goal.\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL):**](https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/1890117931121668256)****\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s fight for a level playing field and reciprocal treatment is common sense. The U.S. is done treating others better than they\u2019re treating us. President Trump understands the art of the deal, and thanks to his strong leadership, we\u2019re getting better deals that will help our businesses and grow our economy!\u201d\n\n[**Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL):**](https://x.com/SenTuberville/status/1890124707082727838)****\u201cPresident Trump is brokering deals that put American farmers, manufacturers, and producers first. America has some of the best and brightest manufacturers and there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t produce most things right here at home.\u201d\n\n[**Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN):**](https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1890135775498629305) \u201cThe master negotiator strikes again. @POTUS is realigning the playing field with countries that have taken advantage of us for far too long and delivering on his promise to put America FIRST.\u201d\n\n[**Chairwoman Lisa McClain (R-MI):**](https://x.com/RepLisaMcClain/status/1890115111064596626)****\u201cPresident Trump is wasting no time leveling the playing field. I am optimistic the pressure applied by the ongoing tariff negotiations will lead to a wave of investment across the U.S. @POTUS is keeping his promise to put our economy first.\u201d\n\n[**Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO):**](https://x.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1890119422670688429)****\u201cPresident Trump understands that American workers and manufacturers can outcompete those of any other nation. But for far too long they have been held back by a lack of reciprocity because other countries impose much higher tariffs and other barriers than the United States imposes on imports. President Trump\u2019s Executive Order helps deliver a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers.\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL):**](https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1890119277573026153)****\u201cPresident Trump has just announced RECIPROCAL TARIFFS for countries unfairly treating American products! If you want to sell to the USA, we must have access to your market as well. What is fair, is fair!\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL):**](https://x.com/RepDonaldsPress/status/1890120064516661501)****\u201cWe will no longer tolerate being ripped-off by the rest of the world. Under President Trump, government is putting the American people first again. And that means RECIPROCAL TARIFFS\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA):**](https://x.com/RepFeenstra/status/1890131271181111432)****\u201cBrazil imposes an 18% tariff on U.S. ethanol while we only charge Brazil 2.5%. In 2024, that imbalance resulted in our nation importing $200 million in Brazilian ethanol while Brazil only imported $52 million in U.S. ethanol. Our farmers deserve better!\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD):**](https://x.com/RepAndyHarrisMD/status/1890116710726091147)****\u201cThe days of America being taken advantage of are over. The \u201cFair and Reciprocal Plan\u201d will put the American worker first and bring fairness back to international trade.\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN):**](https://x.com/RepHarshbarger/status/1890112573942759520)****\u201cOur nation has been at the bad end of business deals regarding trade practices with other countries for far too long. That\u2019s coming to an end. President Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs are putting the world on notice \u2014 the gravy train is over, and we won\u2019t be taken advantage of anymore.\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK):**](https://x.com/repkevinhern/status/1890118251532939747)****\u201cPresident Trump is a strong leader \u2013 he\u2019s not allowing the world to take advantage of the United States any longer. These reciprocal tariffs will incentivize other nations to level the playing field and remove long-standing, exorbitant tariffs. America FIRST!\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Riley Moore (R-WV):**](https://x.com/RepRileyMoore/status/1890123804019708120)****\u201cPresident Trump just announced plans to implement reciprocal tariffs on the foreign countries who are ripping us off. I\u2019m proud to be leading this effort in Congress.\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL):**](https://x.com/RepGregSteube/status/1890129797746921911)****\u201cI thank President Trump for standing up for American workers with his bold plan to restore balance and fairness to the marketplace. He and his administration understand that our workers deserve trade policies that are fair and beneficial to all. \u00a0For far too long, blue-collar communities in the United States have been ripped off by foreign competitors benefiting from manipulative trade practices. If other countries believe they can continue to cheat the American people of their share of prosperity, they are sadly mistaken. President Trump has the right plan to secure our economy, restore fairness to international trade, and bring back good-paying jobs to the United States.\u201d\n\n[**Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-TX):**](https://x.com/RepBethVanDuyne/status/1890123503900536995)****\u201cAmerican workers, farmers, and manufacturers finally have a President who fights for them!

Our best days are still ahead of us!\u201d\n\n[**House Republican Study Committee:**](https://x.com/RepublicanStudy/status/1890117651856560622) \u201cThe Trump administration just announced reciprocal tariffs for countries like China that rip off the United States. It\u2019s past time to flip the script on this. President Trump is trying to restore fairness in trade, ensuring that other countries are held to account for slapping tariffs on American goods. Gone are the days of our great nation being taken advantage of. Period.\u201d\n",
