EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s such a great song.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to cut it off, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 You know?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I want to get you home for the hockey game, I guess.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll get this done real quick \u2014 quickly.\u00a0 And I want to thank you all.\u00a0 We have so many great friends here.\u00a0 A lot of great governors, a lot of talent.\u00a0 I\u2019m thrilled to be with the Republican governors, and they have done an amazing job, and I look forward to working with each and every one of you as we complete the mission of saving America \u2014 they left us a real mess, didn\u2019t they, huh? \u2014 and making our country great again.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re given credit for having the best four weeks that anybody has ever had as an opening, so \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 Now, a few hundred more weeks like this and we\u2019re going to be in great shape.\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019ve had a lot of fun doing it too.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to do it.\u00a0 We just ripped down whatever they\u2019ve done.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost like I want to just do one executive order: Anything he signed is now terminated.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s easier than, you know, point after point after point.\u00a0 I sign and sign.\u00a0 Just do one: Everything he signed is no good.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s really what, basically, it\u2019s all about.\n\nI especially want to thank the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Brian Kemp, who is fantastic.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He was fantastic.\u00a0 We won Georgia by a lot.\u00a0 Where is Brian?\u00a0 We won Georgia by a lot.\u00a0 Where are you, Brian?\u00a0 There you are.\u00a0 And we did a great job together, and I appreciate it.\u00a0 We won\u2019t forget it.\u00a0 Thank you, Brian.\n\nAs well as Vice Chairman Greg Gianforte, a friend of mine who has done a fantastic job as governor \u2014 (applause) \u2014 for organizing this beautiful evening.\n\nIn addition to \u2014 hi, Greg.\u00a0 How you doing?\u00a0 Good?\u00a0 You look good.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 You look good.\n\nIn addition to our fantastic governors, we also have Secretaries Doug Burgum and Chris Wright.\u00a0 They are very important.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Where are they?\u00a0 Where are they?\u00a0 Doug, you were great on television.\u00a0 Chris.\u00a0 These two guys are going to do it.\u00a0 I tell you, if they get the energy bumping, we\u2019ll get that energy price down, and everything is going to follow.\u00a0 Everything is going to follow, and we\u2019re going to work very, very hard.\n\nHere\u2019s a gentleman from Virginia that I recognize that we\u2019ve become \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we almost won that, didn\u2019t we, huh?\u00a0 We almost won it.\u00a0 We were just a little bit shy, but I want to thank you for the help.\u00a0 We did a great job together.\n\nBut another man that\u2019s with us is really unbelievable, and you\u2019re going to be working him very closely: RNC Chairman Michael Whatley.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Michael worked with Lara, and the team of him and Lara were pretty unbeatable, I would say.\u00a0 She was great and had the victory, and she\u2019s solid.\u00a0\n\nThere was no nepotism either.\u00a0 Nobody said, \u201cOh, gee.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cHow did you get her?\u201d\u00a0 And I said to Michael, \u201cSo, who would you like to work with?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, how about Lara again?\u201d\u00a0 But Lara came \u2014 right after we won, she said, \u201cNow, Dad, I want to go home to my family.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 She did a great job, and she just wanted to go back home to the family.\n\nBut what a team that was.\u00a0 We beat them left and right.\u00a0 They tried to cheat, but they \u2014 (laughs) how many lawyers did you have?\u00a0 Like, 2,000 lawyers or some crazy number, right?\n\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Six thousand five hundred.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Six thousand five hundred lawyers.\u00a0 I would say that\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 And the reason I picked him is because, with North Carolina, in 2020 \u2014 we did so great in 2020.\u00a0 But the one that just held steady was him with the 601 lawyers at that time.\u00a0 And I remembered that.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy, because we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\u00a0 But we have to keep them from being really bad, being naughty.\u00a0 They tried.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, we had an expression: We got to make it too big to rig.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we did.\u00a0 Too big to rig.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And it was a great night.\n\nAnd, Michael, thank you.\u00a0 Great \u2014 just a fantastic job.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be working with these ladies and gentlemen on just keeping \u2014 keeping everything, including keeping governor\u2019s seats, I assume.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to work with them on governor\u2019s seats too, right?\n\nBut there\u2019s no better man than Michael.\u00a0 Thank you, Michael.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re gathered tonight at a really exciting time in our nation.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be a very exciting time.\u00a0 We have tremendous potential.\u00a0 I have been called by every company \u2014 Brian just told me about a big one that\u2019s going to be moving in in a very big way.\u00a0 But I have been called by so many big companies that they want to beat the tariffs, and there\u2019s only one way to beat the tariffs.\n\nTariffs, one of the most beautiful words I\u2019ve ever heard.\u00a0 In fact, I went around saying it\u2019s my favorite word in the dictionary, and I got killed by the fake news media.\u00a0 They said, \u201cWhat about God?\u00a0 What about religion?\u00a0 What about love?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cAll right.\u00a0 I give up.\u00a0 It\u2019s my fourth favorite word.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, now I say God, religion, love, and then tariffs, number four.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 And now I\u2019m okay.\u00a0 I can get away with that.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t get away with making it number one, but it\u2019s close.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nThe American people gave Republicans a historic mandate in November \u2014 you remember that, November 5th \u2014 what a day that was, huh?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 No \u2014 there was no games.\u00a0 November 5th, 2024, will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country.\u00a0 I believe that.\n\nWe won the House.\u00a0 We won the Senate.\u00a0 We won the White House.\u00a0 And, in the presidential race, we won all seven swing states by a lot, and the popular vote by millions and millions of votes for the first time of any Republican in decades.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard for us to win the popular vote, but it\u2019s not going to be anymore, because we\u2019re a much different Republican Party right now.\n\nWe\u2019re really \u2014 nobody can believe what\u2019s happened to this party.\u00a0 It\u2019s become a big party, really big and powerful party.\n\nWe won 85 percent of all counties in America.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 Eighty-five percent.\u00a0 Have you seen the map?\u00a0 It\u2019s all red.\u00a0 There\u2019s a little blue on the outside here and \u2014 the outside.\u00a0 The whole thing is, like, red.\u00a0\n\nThey won 525 counties compared to us \u2014 2,600 counties.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why we only won by millions of votes.\u00a0 We should have won by a lot more than that.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s because they cheated.\u00a0 Who knows?\n\nAnd incredibly, all 50 states shifted toward the Republican Party.\u00a0 That\u2019s never happened before.\u00a0 It\u2019s the first time ever in history that that\u2019s happened.\u00a0 All 50 states shifted toward the Republicans \u2014 and significantly, in many cases.\n\nMost importantly for this room, we\u2019re pleased to welcome eight new Republican governors.\u00a0 Could you stand up please?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Just stand up.\u00a0 Look at these people.\u00a0 Oh, I know them.\u00a0 I know the men.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 I know every one of them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nMike Braun of Indiana.\u00a0 Mike Kehoe of Missouri.\u00a0 Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.\u00a0 Larry Rhoden \u2014 that\u2019s great \u2014 Larry Rhoden of South Dakota.\u00a0 Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota.\u00a0 Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.\u00a0 Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n of Puerto Rico.\u00a0 Nikolao Pula of American Samoa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I want to congratulate you all.\u00a0 You had great races.\u00a0 You won, generally, pretty easily.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to win a lot of races.\u00a0\n\nYou know, in presidential races, they say when you win the presidency, usually the midterms don\u2019t go well.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to do great.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to really increase our margins by a lot.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why I went to Michael.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou got to stay.\u00a0 You can\u2019t go anywhere, Michael.\u201d\n\nBut I can tell you that I did something very different.\u00a0 Our win was so big and so conclusive presidentially \u2014 and we had great help from donors.\u00a0 We have a lot of great donors in the room tonight, but \u2014\n\nThis is a nice room, by the way.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very nice place.\n\nBut we did something differently.\u00a0 I said that \u2014 to my people that do the fundraising, I said, \u201cListen, everyone is so happy.\u201d\u00a0 Usually, you wait two or three years to go back to the donors.\u00a0 You know, you let it rest.\u00a0 You let their wallets cool off a little bit.\u00a0 But I did it the next morning after we won.\u00a0(laughter).\n\nI said to Meredith, who may or may not be here \u2014 I don\u2019t think she is.\u00a0 Maybe she is.\u00a0 She\u2019s great and \u2014 but I said to a whole staff of people \u2014 I said, \u201cCall everybody and see if they\u2019ll double up.\u201d\n\nNow, we raised a billion six.\u00a0 They raised $2.7 billion, and they\u2019re running short.\u00a0 They can\u2019t raise the final 28.\u00a0 You know, when you lose, it\u2019s very hard to raise money.\u00a0 But when you win, it\u2019s not so hard.\u00a0\n\nI said, \u201cSee what you can do.\u00a0 Call everybody and say, \u2018Thank you very much.\u00a0 We appreciate it.\u00a0 Would you like to make a contribution?\u2019\u201d\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nSo, this was not a good situation, but they fully understood.\u00a0 They were so happy, they didn\u2019t care.\u00a0\n\nAnd, Michael, we raised $608 million in three weeks.\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0 Six \u2014 so we\u2019ve got that money, and I got to spend it somewhere.\u00a0 And they tell me I\u2019m not allowed to run.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0 Is that true?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nSo, if I can\u2019t spend it on me, I guess that means I\u2019m going to be spending it on some of my friends, right?\u00a0 A lot of my friends who are going to be running.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nBut think of that.\u00a0 We raised $608 million.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that great?\u00a0 And I think I\u2019ll keep going.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just keep bugging them, bugging them, build it up.\u00a0 But it\u2019s going to be great.\u00a0\n\nI think we\u2019re going to do fantastically.\u00a0 I think the midterms are going to be a big surprise.\u00a0 And it just seems \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is.\u00a0 You go back to the last, I think, eight elections in a row, the midterms haven\u2019t been great for the person that wins the presidency.\u00a0 And I think, so far, we\u2019re very popular.\u00a0\n\nI had an approval rating today of 71 and another one of 69.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I have not heard of those numbers before.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to fight very hard, because the better I do, the better you do.\u00a0 It makes your races a lot easier if we do well, and we\u2019re going to keep doing well.\n\nWith the help of everyone here tonight, the golden age of America has officially begun and the golden age of \u2014 just this whole thing \u2014 the red states \u2014 it\u2019s going to be leading the way to making our country richer and safer and stronger than ever before.\u00a0\n\nThe red states are going to do good.\u00a0 And the blue states \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe they\u2019ll totally disappear off that map.\n\nYou know, they don\u2019t learn, because \u2014 you know, like men in women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 I say we\u2019ve become the party of common sense.\u00a0 Men in women\u2019s sports is not a winner for them.\u00a0 But I saw somebody fighting like hell for the fact that a man should partake in women\u2019s sports \u2014 a Democrat, a radical left lunatic.\u00a0 And they\u2019re still going at it.\n\nAnd we shouldn\u2019t really fight them too hard until just about a week or two before the election.\u00a0 Just let them go.\u00a0 Don\u2019t convince them not to.\u00a0\n\nYou know, I\u2019m always saying, \u201cThey haven\u2019t learned.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to say that.\u00a0 Don\u2019t say that.\u00a0 Let them keep going.\u00a0 And then about a week before the election, just blast the hell out of them.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s like in a race.\u00a0 You know, you hang in there, and then you just go.\u00a0 Because there\u2019s no way \u2014 open borders with prisoners coming in.\u00a0 Jails.\u00a0 Some of the worst murderers in the world.\u00a0\n\nWe had \u2014 one guy killed five people \u2014 separately killed five different people.\u00a0 This is not going to be a great person for our county.\n\nBut we had 11,088 murderers right now.\u00a0 Some of them have been already brought back.\u00a0 And you know, when you think about it, transgender everything.\u00a0 Everybody should be transgender.\u00a0 These are not things that play very well.\u00a0 I would say they\u2019re 7 percent issues for them, and they\u2019re over 90 percent for us.\u00a0 But they keep going.\u00a0\n\nSo, don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s too long.\u00a0 Two years or four years.\u00a0 It\u2019s too long.\u00a0 Let them continue to go and say, \u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant idea to have open borders, to allow prisons and mental institution people to pour in from all over the world.\u201d\u00a0 Everywhere.\u00a0 They came from everywhere.\u00a0\n\nBut about a week before that election, go crazy.\u00a0 Just save up your money and explain we can\u2019t live like this.\u00a0 And they understand it.\u00a0\n\nEvery day of my administration will be fighting to help your state succeed and prosper.\u00a0 And together, we\u2019re going to bring back the American dream \u2014 something nobody talks about anymore.\u00a0\n\nIn our last four weeks, our new administration has accomplished more than most administrations do in four years, and the last administration was a negative.\u00a0 I mean, it was accomplishment \u2014 I would say negative 50 percent.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t any accomplishment.\u00a0 There was de-accomplishment.\u00a0\n\nOn day one, I declared a national emergency on our southern border.\u00a0 I sent our military to the border to secure the sovereign territory of the United States of America.\u00a0 We ended catch and release.\u00a0 We began the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\u00a0 You know, he was sort of a moderate guy, but he was very strong on the fact he didn\u2019t want people pouring into our country from all over the world.\u00a0 He was very tough.\u00a0 He had the record.\u00a0\n\nWe now have the record.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a record I\u2019m really proud of.\u00a0 You don\u2019t like to do that, but we have no choice.\u00a0 We can\u2019t let it \u2014 I mean, they let criminals \u2014 many, many criminals \u2014 hundreds of thousands, probably millions of criminals.\u00a0 Twenty-one million people, I believe, is the number.\u00a0 And of that, millions of people are hard, stone-cold criminals.\u00a0\n\nIn the past four weeks, illegal border crossings have plummeted by nearly 100 percent, and the tiny number of illegals that do make it across are being apprehended and sent right back to their home, where they belong.\u00a0 All countries are taking the illegal aliens back \u2014 every single one, even though they said, and strongly, \u201cWe\u2019re never taking them back.\u00a0 Don\u2019t even try.\u201d\u00a0 They said that during the Biden administration.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t work.\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re taking them back.\u00a0 They have no choice.\u00a0 They\u2019re taking them back.\u00a0 They know we\u2019re not playing games.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nYou remember Venezuela saying it: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking them back.\u00a0 Don\u2019t even waste your time.\u201d\u00a0 They said that to Biden.\u00a0 He said, \u201cWell, they have us over a barrel.\u201d\u00a0 They don\u2019t have us over a barrel.\u00a0\n\nHow about BRICS?\u00a0 You know, the BRICS states?\u00a0 There are, like, six of them, and they were trying to destroy our dollar.\u00a0 They were going to say \u2014 you know, they wanted to create a new currency.\u00a0 They probably wanted to use the yuan, China.\u00a0 They wanted to use the yuan.\u00a0 And Biden said, \u201cWell, this is a tough situation.\u00a0 There\u2019s not much we can do about that.\u00a0 We can\u2019t help that.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cOh, we can help it.\u201d\n\nSo, when I came in, the first thing I said is: Any BRICS state that even mentions the destruction of the dollar will be charged a 150 percent tariff.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t want your goods.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to partake.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And the BRICS states just broke up.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what the hell happened to them.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t heard from the BRICS states lately.\n\nBut he said that wasn\u2019t much we could do about it.\u00a0 There was a lot.\u00a0 It took once \u2014 literally.\u00a0 They said, \u201cSir, what about the BRICS states?\u00a0 They\u2019re going to take over the dollar, the sanctity of the dollar.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to create a new currency to rule the world.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cYes, they are, sir.\u00a0 They said it.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u00a0 Tell them 150 percent tariff, plus we\u2019re not going to do business with them, and that includes China.\u201d\n\nAnd all of a sudden, they went to the BRICS states, and they said, \u201cCould I ask you, how do you feel about the\u201d \u2014 \u201cI have no comment on this.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about.\u201d\u00a0 It was an amazing turnaround.\u00a0\n\nNo, we\u2019re not playing games.\u00a0\n\nJust this week, I officially designated the drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which gives us great power.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd to facilitate the rapid deportation of the worst criminals that we have anywhere in the world, we\u2019ve also opened the full capacity of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\u00a0 You know, people don\u2019t realize that thing was built \u2014 you know, we hear about a few prisoners, and they do have maximum security, but it holds \u2014 actually, it was built for thousands and thousands of people, and we\u2019re using that prior to bringing back to their country.\u00a0\n\nWe use it for the bad ones, the really bad ones.\u00a0 And in some cases, they\u2019re so bad, we don\u2019t want them to go back to the country.\u00a0 We want to watch them, because they\u2019ll be able \u2014 if they do sneak in, we don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want them anywhere near our country.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re waging war on Joe Biden\u2019s inflation disaster, the worst inflation probably in our history.\u00a0 They say 48 years, which isn\u2019t bad, but probably in our history.\u00a0 And to bring down the price of energy, I declared a national energy emergency.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be an emergency.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And you know what our \u2014 what we say and what Doug is going to do \u2014 Doug, you are so important, you and Chris.\u00a0\n\nYou know, Chris is known \u2014 and I got this from Doug \u2014 as the best energy guy in the entire country.\u00a0 And people were shocked that he wanted to do this.\u00a0 He gave up something tremendous.\u00a0 He was the biggest guy.\u00a0 There was nobody bigger, nobody better than Chris Wright.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nIs Chris Wright here?\u00a0 Is he here?\u00a0 Where is he?\u00a0 This guy is \u2014 and this is from Doug.\u00a0I said, \u201cDoug, I want to make you the Energy czar.\u201d\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, there\u2019s one man that blows me away.\u201d\u00a0 Right, Doug?\u00a0 He said, \u201cHis name is Chris Wright.\u00a0 He\u2019s much better.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI want to see this man,\u201d and I met him.\u00a0 And I just agreed immediately that he was far superior to Doug.\u00a0 I\u2019m only kidding.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nSo, what I did \u2014 we have a weird deal.\u00a0 You know, we have the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior, and Interior has all of the energy.\u00a0 And Doug has none of the energy, but he\u2019s got \u2014 Chris has none of the energy, but he got a hell of a good title.\u00a0 But we want the guy with the energy to be able to drill, so we sort of merged them.\u00a0 And they\u2019re friends and everything else, and they\u2019ve got a thing going on.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to set records like nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u00a0\n\nSo, we have the man that controls the energy, we have the man that drills the energy, and now we\u2019ve put them together, and you\u2019re going to see some action.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You\u2019re going to see something come way down.\u00a0\n\nSo, thank you.\u00a0 And thank you, Doug.\u00a0 You were really a terrific \u2014 he was a great governor, by the way.\u00a0 A couple of you may know him slightly.\u00a0 But he was a great governor.\u00a0 Did a fantastic job.\u00a0\n\nYou know, he made a lot of money in the technology business.\u00a0 Sold to Microsoft for a lot of money.\u00a0 I won\u2019t tell you how much.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to embarrass him.\u00a0 Some people would say it\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 Some people would say it wasn\u2019t that much, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But, you know, when you get close to a billion dollars, that\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t know much about energy.\u00a0 When he became governor, he became one of the great experts of energy anywhere.\u00a0 We did unbelievable \u2014 really, an unbelievable job with the state.\u00a0 He did like me: He did well in business, and then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s run for politics.\u201d\u00a0 And he did, and they love him in the state.\u00a0 But he was term-limited, and I watched him running.\u00a0 It was running against me, but I still liked him.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I said, \u201cThat guy\u2019s got real talent,\u201d and he was one of the first people I called.\u00a0\n\nSo, you\u2019re doing a great job, and thank you for giving us \u2014 for leading us to Chris.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you a bigger thank you in two years if Chris is as good as you say.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I know he\u2019s going to be.\u00a0\n\nThanks a lot, Chris.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Go out there.\u00a0\n\nIf we can bring energy down, everything\u2019s coming down.\u00a0 You know, the eggs are coming down, and the bacon is coming down.\u00a0 Everything is coming down.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the biggest thing, the energy.\u00a0 So, those two guys are very important.\n\nTo cut through the red tape, I\u2019ve established a National Energy Dominance Council chaired by your former colleague, Secretary Burgum.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to do a fantastic job.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting incredible people on it.\u00a0\n\nI withdrew from the one-sided and very expensive Paris Climate Accord.\u00a0 It\u2019s a one-way street.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You know, under that accord, we pay $1 trillion.\u00a0 Think of it.\u00a0 We pay a trillion dollars.\u00a0 They pay nothing.\u00a0 China doesn\u2019t pay anything.\u00a0 India doesn\u2019t pay anything.\u00a0 Russia doesn\u2019t pay.\u00a0 We just pay everybody.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s like a health organization, and every one of the \u2014 every deal is no good, but we\u2019re changing it.\u00a0 We terminated health \u2014 you know, on the world health, we paid a hundred \u2014 we paid $500 million a year, and China paid $39 million a year.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d\u00a0 They have 1.4 billion people, and we have \u2014 nobody knows what the hell our number is, because so many people pour into our country. \u00a0We used to say, like, 325.\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00a0 We\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\u00a0 But let\u2019s put it this way: It should be substantially less than 1.4.\u00a0\n\nBut we have \u2014 let\u2019s say we have 325 million.\u00a0 They have 1.4.\u00a0 We\u2019re paying $500 million.\u00a0 And these aren\u2019t \u2014 I mean, relative to government, these aren\u2019t huge numbers, but this is an example of what happens when you have bad government, when you have incompetent people.\u00a0\n\nSo, I would explain this, and they called me, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you in for the same $39 million.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, we should be much less than 39.\u00a0 We should be\u201d \u2014 but I didn\u2019t even want to do that, because I\u2019m not going to talk \u2014 I said, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u00a0 And it was very public.\u00a0 And when Biden came in, he agreed to go back in to the World Health for $500 million.\u00a0 He could have gotten \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a lot of money.\u00a0 You could have gotten it for $39 million, Joe.\u00a0 That\u2019s why you\u2019re not president any longer, I guess.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0\n\nNo, he could have had it for 39.\u00a0 They were standing there, \u201cWe\u2019re going to\u201d \u2014 it was very public.\u00a0 But he went in \u2014 he took the $500 million instead, because he never laid in bed at night, sweating, tossing and turning, like half of these governors \u2014 not all of them, probably, but half of them.\u00a0 They\u2019re sweating, \u201cHow are we going to do a great job?\u201d\u00a0 He never did that.\u00a0\n\nBut that\u2019s just a case study in, you know, how not to run.\u00a0 Because, you know, if we \u2014 if we had people at that level that would have negotiated \u2014 I bought a plane.\u00a0 It\u2019s really two planes.\u00a0 Air Force One.\u00a0 Now, if Boeing would build a damn thing, it would be nice too.\u00a0 We don\u2019t build like we used to.\u00a0 We don\u2019t build too fast.\u00a0 I gave the order out about six years ago.\u00a0 They\u2019re still waiting.\u00a0 Getting a little tired of it.\u00a0\n\nI gave a fixed-price deal, but it was $5.7 billion.\u00a0 I negotiated with Boeing.\u00a0 It took about two months, and I got the 5.7 down to $4 billion.\u00a0 Actually, one penny less than 4.\u00a0 I said, \u201cIt has to have a three on it.\u201d\u00a0 And he said, \u201cYou want from 5.7 to 3?\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYeah, three on it, meaning it has to start with a three.\u201d\u00a0 And after about two months of saying, \u201cNo, no, no, no, it has to have a three.\u00a0 It has to have a three,\u201d he called up.\u00a0 He said, \u201cSir, 3 bil-\u201c \u2014 what I want, and this is what happened: $3,999,999,999.99.\u00a0 One penny less.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou have a deal.\u201d\u00a0 But we saved $1.7 billion just by negotiating.\u00a0\n\nAnd in all fairness, mostly, you can do that.\u00a0 And some of you do do it.\u00a0 Some of you do.\u00a0 You know, you have surplus states.\u00a0 You have incredible states, and you have to do that, because every time somebody sends you a bill, they expect to be negotiated.\u00a0 And in the past administration \u2014 and sometimes, I guess, in this, it happens, because people don\u2019t care.\u00a0\n\nYou know, Elon talks about caring.\u00a0 Caring is very important.\u00a0 And they have to care.\u00a0 If they care, they say, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll pay you\u201d \u2014 they\u2019ll send you a bill for $10,000, and you say, \u201cNope, I\u2019ll give you five.\u201d\u00a0 And they\u2019ll say, \u201cNo way, no way, no way,\u201d and you\u2019ll end up paying six or seven or something.\u00a0 But all you have to do is care a little bit and try and get it down.\u00a0\n\nAnd literally, every contract.\u00a0 I think, there\u2019s not a contract that\u2019s sent in government that I couldn\u2019t \u2014 and that many of you couldn\u2019t cut and cut very substantially.\u00a0 And boy, what a difference it would make for the government.\u00a0\n\nI terminated the Green New Scam, one of the great scams in the history of our country.\u00a0 I canceled Joe Biden\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry from destruction.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That was an easy one.\u00a0 And all of this helps to combat inflation and bring down costs.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re bringing down costs way down.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to bring up jobs like you haven\u2019t seen because the companies pouring in.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have announcements over the next three, four weeks that you\u2019re not going to believe from some of the biggest companies in the world.\u00a0 And the numbers are staggering: hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, hundreds and hundreds \u2014 trillions of dollars, when you add it up.\u00a0\n\nTo slash hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud, we\u2019re talking about also \u2014 and abuse \u2014 I\u2019ve created, as you possibly have read just a little bit, the Department of Government Efficiency.\u00a0 (Applause.) And here are just some of the things that we\u2019ve paid, and we\u2019ve stopped, and we\u2019ve gotten the money back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $520 million for a consultant to do ESG \u2014 that\u2019s environmental, social, and governance investments \u2014 in Africa \u2014 $525 million.\u00a0\n\n$25 million to promote biodiversity, conservation, and social responsibility behavior in Colombia.\u00a0\n\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.\u00a0 Nobody even knows what the hell it means.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\n$42 million for social and behavioral change in Uganda.\u00a0\n\n$10 million for Mozambique medical male circumcision.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing circumcisions in Mozambique to the tune of approximately $12 million.\u00a0\n\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n\n$486 million to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and $21 million for voter turnout in India.\u00a0 Why are we caring about India turnout?\u00a0 We got enough problems.\u00a0 We want our own turnout, don\u2019t we?\u00a0 Can you imagine, all that money going to India?\u00a0 I wonder what they think when they get it.\u00a0\n\nNow, it\u2019s a kickback scheme.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s not like they get it and they spend \u2014 they kick it back to the people that send it, I would say, in many cases \u2014 many of these cases.\u00a0 Anytime you have no idea what we\u2019re talking about, that means there\u2019s a kickback, because nobody has any idea what\u2019s going on here.\u00a0\n\n$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.\u00a0 Nobody knows what they mean by \u201cpolitical landscape.\u201d\u00a0 What does that mean?\n\n$20 million for fiscal federalism and $19 million for biodiversity in Nepal.\u00a0\n\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.\u00a0 What the hell do I care about?\u00a0 We got a lot.\u00a0 We got enough problems.\n\nAnd all of this is terminated.\u00a0 We terminated this stuff, and we\u2019re on the track.\u00a0 And, by the way, so many others I could have \u2014 I could \u2014 I could read all night long.\u00a0 But so many were so terrible, and some \u2014 some were actually disgusting.\u00a0 And I know you\u2019re eating your dinner, so I didn\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nBut we\u2019re draining the swamp.\u00a0 And, you know, one of them was $100 million for condoms for Hamas.\u00a0 You heard about that.\u00a0 Fifty and fifty.\u00a0 It\u2019s $50 million, and then they decided they needed more condoms, so they sent another $50 million.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s $100 million \u2014 condoms for Hamas.\u00a0\n\nBut now that\u2019s the good stuff.\u00a0 Here\u2019s even worse: Social Security.\u00a0 As you know, generally speaking, people don\u2019t live to be over 100 years old.\u00a0 We all will, I think \u2014 120, 130, hopefully.\u00a0 But, you know, you hate \u2014 when you get near that number, it\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s hope we can live to length like this.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 But here\u2019s what we\u2019re finding and what we found, and these were all found by these computer geniuses.\u00a0\n\nI asked Elon, \u201cWhat trait do these have?\u201d\u00a0 You know, they started off with 12 guys, then they had 30 guys, then they had 57 guys.\u00a0 Now they have over 100 guys.\u00a0 And he attracts very young people with high IQs.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 Some people attract very beautiful people.\u00a0 I think I like them better, actually.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But he attracts young people that are brilliant, and they love the country too.\u00a0\n\nBut I said, \u201cWhat trait do they really have?\u201d\u00a0 And the trait that they really have was that they\u2019re extraordinary with computers.\u00a0 They can take them \u2014 he said, \u201cThey make love to their computer.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about that.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t sound too\u201d \u2014 (laughter).\u00a0 He said, \u201cThey can take apart the most complex computer instruments and \u2014 and literally put them back blindfolded.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, when they go into some guy that\u2019s ripping off the country by doing some of the things you\u2019ve just heard or what you\u2019re going to hear, they can\u2019t be bullshitted.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 They can\u2019t say, \u201cOh, gee, there was a mistake.\u00a0 There was a big mistake.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re finding hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of fraud, waste, and abuse.\u00a0 But I think fraud will be the number one as we see.\u00a0\n\nBut listen to this.\u00a0 On the program, there are 4.7 million Social Security members who go and live from 100 to 109.\u00a0 Well, I\u2019ll tell you, I know some people that are close to 100.\u00a0 I know one or two that got over that mark.\u00a0 But you get \u2014 you don\u2019t have millions.\u00a0\n\n3.6 million people from age 110 to age 119.\u00a0 3.47 million people from age 120 to 129.\u00a0 In other words, 120 to 129 years old, millions of people \u2014 millions.\u00a0 3.9 million people from age 130 to 139, which is pretty amazing, because the longest-living person ever on record \u2014 and they\u2019re not sure it was correct \u2014 was a woman from a very faraway place lived to 127 years old.\u00a0 She was a healthy specimen.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But she lived to 127.\n\n3.5 million people from age 140 to 149.\u00a0 So, we have 140-year-old people, plus.\u00a0 Millions of them.\u00a0 1.3 million people live to over 150 years of age \u2014 150 to 159, to be exact.\u00a0 Over 130,000 people over the age of 160 years old, including 1,039 people between the ages of 220 to 229.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be investigating this fraud.\u00a0 The \u2014 actually, we had one person at \u2014 who was 361 years old.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And what we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re finding how many of these people were paid.\u00a0 So, we have millions of people \u2014 could be well over 100 million people on our Social Security rolls.\u00a0\n\nSo, the good news is, when we take them off, whether they were paid or not, it looks like our Social Security could be really solid.\u00a0 It could be a lot better than we thought, if you think about it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to do something \u2014 I\u2019m actually going on this one.\u00a0 You know, all my life I\u2019ve heard about Fort Knox.\u00a0 That\u2019s where the gold is kept, right?\u00a0 I heard, \u201cFort Knox.\u00a0 Oh, ho, ho.\u201d\u00a0 But, you know, we\u2019re getting a little bit shaky.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting the yips on this stuff.\u00a0 Like, I want to find out.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to open up the doors.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to see if we have gold there.\u00a0 We want to find out: Did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty amazing place.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to actually go.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to open the doors.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to inspect Fort Knox.\u00a0 We want to make sure that we actually have, you know, 400 tons of gold or whatever the hell it is.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of gold.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to open it and the cupboards are bare.\u00a0 Could happen.\n\nIf you look at some of the things \u2014 oh, by the way, wait until we go into the Education Department.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t even done that.\u00a0 So, we \u2014 we could find as much as $1.5 trillion worth of waste, fraud, and abuse.\u00a0 If we do that, we can balance budgets.\u00a0 We can do a lot of other things, especially when you couple it with the massive amounts of tariffs that are coming in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Already, you know, just with what we are charging \u2014 I won\u2019t mention the country because I don\u2019t want to anger people that like me, and I like them very much.\u00a0 But we\u2019re finding at least $60 billion a year in one country alone.\u00a0 And I haven\u2019t even started, it\u2019s just a very small portion that I\u2019ve, you know, attached to them.\u00a0\n\nSo, I got a call from Congress.\u00a0 They said, \u201cYou know, a lot of money is coming in from these tariffs,\u201d and they\u2019re starting to change their whole thing.\u00a0\n\nSo, if you can add the tariffs \u2014 and this is numbers that \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say it, because then they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe didn\u2019t produce.\u201d\u00a0 But you could wipe out your income tax.\u00a0 You could maybe not even have an income tax system when this thing works out.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because in the old days, that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0\n\nYou know, our country was the richest ever from 1870 to 1913.\u00a0 That\u2019s when we were actually the richest, and we were a full tariff country.\n\nMcKinley \u2014 and I just \u2014 by the way, I just renamed Mount McKinley \u201cMount McKinley.\u201d\u00a0 I hope you\u2019re happy about that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But McKinley was a president.\u00a0 He was a tariff guy, and he believed that countries should not be allowed to come in and plunder.\u00a0 He would see \u2014 he had beautiful language on tariffs.\u00a0 Plunder our wealth, plunder our jobs, steal our companies, and take without paying a very fair price.\u00a0\n\nAnd he said \u2014 and that price should be more than fair.\u00a0 It should be high, because what they do is they hurt our country.\u00a0 And we became very rich.\u00a0 He was assassinated.\u00a0 And, as you know, Roosevelt took over \u2014 Teddy.\u00a0 And he spent money on parks and on dams and on everything.\u00a0 I mean, you know \u2014 but he really spent a lot of the money \u2014 McKinley never got the credit \u2014 but he spent a lot of the money that McKinley made.\n\nBut it was the richest we ever were in the 1800s, early 1900s.\u00a0 And then, in 1913, we went to the income tax system.\u00a0 And to be honest, we did fine, but we were never like we were.\u00a0 They formed the tariff commission of 1887, and it was a commission of people like you.\u00a0 Blue bloods.\u00a0 Are you blue bloods?\u00a0 There are a couple in \u2014 about three of them over here.\u00a0 But blue bloods.\u00a0\n\nBut it was a commission, and it was set up for the sole purpose of \u2014 we have so much money.\u00a0 This is in the United States.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know \u2014 we had no debt.\u00a0 We had no nothing.\u00a0 We had massive amounts of money.\u00a0 The commission was set up to determine where we should spend our money.\u00a0 Where do we spend it?\u00a0 Got so much.\u00a0\n\nCan you imagine?\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\u00a0 Now look at what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But this is money we have to borrow where they\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to find out that this money went to people and it got kicked back.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to find out a lot of that.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll catch it all.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve launched the largest deregulation campaign in our country\u2019s history.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0 For every 1 new regulation, I\u2019ve directed that 10 old regulations must be eliminated.\u00a0\n\nAnd I will say, in my first term, we did more deregulation than any president in history, by far.\u00a0 Not even close.\n\nWith Republicans in Congress, we\u2019re also racing to pass the largest tax cuts in American history.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to \u2014 we brought it down from 41 percent \u2014 much higher, if you add the state things \u2014 but 41 percent to 21 percent, which people said was impossible.\u00a0 And now I\u2019m trying to bring it down to 15 percent.\n\nSo, it\u2019ll go from 21 to 15, but only if you make your product in the United States of America.\u00a0 Otherwise, you pay 21 percent.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That would be great.\n\nTo protect American auto workers, which \u2014 who, by the way, they\u2019re going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what we\u2019re doing with tariffs \u2014 because they just stopped two big auto plants in the middle of construction from being built in Mexico because they see \u2014 when I got elected, they saw, \u201cOh, this is going to be a problem for us.\u201d\u00a0 Because we have big tariffs going on, and we have tariffs going on autos.\n\nAnd they don\u2019t have to pay any tariffs.\u00a0 There is no tariff.\u00a0 All you have to do is build your plant in the United States.\u00a0 They were building plants in Mexico, right opposite the border.\u00a0 They\u2019re making them in Mexico.\u00a0 They\u2019re selling them into the United States with virtually no tax.\u00a0 And they\u2019re killing all our \u2014 Detroit \u2014 all these places are being killed.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s the exact opposite.\u00a0\n\nAnd by the way, Canada was a big participant in that too.\u00a0 And I think Canada \u2014 you know, they\u2019re going to have to pay tariffs on automobiles, lumber, and oil and gas, et cetera, et cetera.\u00a0 And they get 95 percent of their product from the United States.\u00a0 I think they have to become the 51st state.\u00a0\n\nAnd you heard the people booing the national anthem, but I think, ultimately, they\u2019ll be praising the national anthem.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to work out some deal \u2014 because I do like the \u201cO Canada.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to have to keep it for the 51st state.\u00a0\n\nI call him Governor Trudeau.\u00a0 I said, \u201cGovernor Trudeau is doing a wonderful job.\u201d\u00a0 I think it\u2019s actually cost him his election, if you want to know the truth.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to see about that.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at Greenland, and we have to take back the Panama Canal, because that wasn\u2019t the deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nWe gave the Panama Canal to Panama.\u00a0 It was the most expensive thing ever built in our country.\u00a0 It would be the equivalent of $2 trillion today.\u00a0 We spent massive amounts.\u00a0 We lost 38,000 lives from the mosquito and snakes.\u00a0 A lot of bad snake bites, but mostly the mosquitoes.\u00a0 They \u2014 malaria \u2014 they killed 38,000 of our people.\u00a0\n\nThey paid laborers five times what they were getting in the United States to go, knowing that there was a good chance they were going to die.\u00a0 Twenty percent of them died.\u00a0\n\nAnd Jimmy Carter, may he rest in peace \u2014 the late, great Jimmy Carter \u2014 gave it away for $1.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also the most profitable thing ever built.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s \u2014 what you hear about casinos and you hear about all this stuff \u2014 they\u2019re peanuts compared to this.\u00a0 It\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s the most profitable thing ever built.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s never been anything \u2014 I mean, you have ships lined up.\u00a0 And by the way, when they gave it away \u2014 they gave it away like a bunch of dummies for $1.\u00a0 The day after they took over, they raised the price per ship by four times.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t high enough.\u00a0 There was no \u2014 no problem.\u00a0 They raised it again twice.\u00a0 And they\u2019re getting almost a million dollars a ship.\u00a0\n\nAnd their product is water.\u00a0 It\u2019s Pacific and Atlantic, where they meet.\u00a0 And one is about 18 feet higher than the other, which a lot of people don\u2019t know. \u00a0Actually, it\u2019s one of the great marvels of the world.\u00a0\n\nWell, we built it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re not going to let \u2014 because China has essentially taken it over.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u00a0 China knows it, and so does Panama.\u00a0\n\nTo protect American workers and bring billions of dollars into our treasury, we\u2019re in the process of imposing reciprocal tariffs on any nation that tries to cheat us or steal our jobs.\u00a0\n\nSo, India, as an example, has very, very high tariffs, and I was going to impose a flat tariff, but that wouldn\u2019t really do the trick, because some of the countries have really high tariffs.\u00a0\n\nSo, it really works out much better.\u00a0 Nobody can even fight it.\u00a0 Whatever they charge us, we charge them.\u00a0 So, if they\u2019re at 25 percent, we are 25.\u00a0 If they\u2019re at 75, we\u2019re at \u2014\n\nWhatever they charge us \u2014 and it was very interesting.\u00a0 The European Union \u2014 you know, we were at 2.5 percent for cars.\u00a0 European Union was much higher.\u00a0 They just reduced their tariffs on cars to 2.5 to be reciprocal with ours.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s just an early sign.\u00a0 But I think that\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0\n\nAnd then some will \u2014 some will want to fight us a little bit, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 They\u2019re reciprocal.\u00a0 And even the press says, \u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u00a0 Well, they don\u2019t fight us.\u00a0\n\nYou know, if I put a flat tariff on, like, 25, 30 percent, even if it was lower than we would have gotten, if we put a flat tariff on, the press would have gone crazy.\u00a0 \u201cWe \u2014 that\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u00a0 Even if somebody was paying, like, five times more, charging us five times more.\n\nWhen you say reciprocal \u2014 I said it the other day to the failing New York Times.\u00a0 I said, \u201cListen, whatever they charge us, we charge them.\u201d\u00a0 They go, \u201cWell, that sounds fair.\u201d\u00a0 It truly does, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nSo, it\u2019s a reciprocal tariff.\u00a0 Whatever they charge us.\n\nI\u2019ve ended Joe Biden\u2019s weaponization of our government and removed his handpicked radical-left, Marxist prosecutors from the Department of Justice.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have a great attorney general: Pam.\n\nI immediately halted all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.\u00a0 I signed an executive order to end all of the lawless diversity, equity, and inclusion policies across the entire federal government and private sector.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nDo you see how much it costs?\u00a0 One company said they\u2019re going out of that business and they\u2019re going to write off $229 million.\u00a0 The \u2014 how do you spend that much money to convince people that they should have transgender operations and various and sundry other things that we don\u2019t like to talk about?\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s crazy the amount of money that was \u2014 it was almost like a \u2014 just a mind-blower what they were doing.\u00a0 It was terrible and all over.\u00a0\n\nAnd by the way, our military is now free of that.\u00a0 Anybody that even tries it, they\u2019re gone.\u00a0 I signed really historic orders to get critical race theory and transgender ideology out of the schools and out of our military.\u00a0 It\u2019s all going out.\u00a0 It\u2019s no longer.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I heard men are still playing in Maine.\u00a0 Is anybody here from Maine?\u00a0 Ah.\u00a0 Who is that?\u00a0 Is that the governor?\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 well, I hate to tell you this, but we\u2019re not going to give them any federal money.\u00a0 They are still saying we want men to play in women\u2019s sports, and I cannot believe that they\u2019re doing that.\u00a0 They are \u2014 (inaudible) find out who that guy is that raised his hand.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019s just kidding.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nBut \u2014 so, we\u2019re not going to give them any federal funding \u2014 none whatsoever \u2014 until they clean that up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the other one, we has \u2014 have a fight with one news organization: AP, a radical-left organization.\u00a0 Treats us all very badly.\u00a0 And they refuse to acknowledge that the Gulf \u2014 former \u2014 of Mexico is now called the Gulf of America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nSo, we just hold them \u2014 we\u2019re holding them \u2014 we\u2019re holding them out of our \u2014 any news conferences.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get sued, and maybe they\u2019ll win.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 It\u2019s just something that we feel strongly about.\n\nNo, and I said we changed Mount McKinley.\u00a0 Nobody is fighting that.\u00a0 You\u2019re allowed to do it \u2014 what we\u2019re allowed to do.\u00a0 And most of the shoreline is \u2014 you know, 85 percent of it is on our soil, but I thought it would be appropriate.\u00a0\n\nI never understood, quite, the Gulf of Mexico when it really covers us far more.\u00a0 And I think Doug is a big believer in what we did \u2014 the Gulf of America.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re having a little dispute, but only one.\u00a0 But Google Maps has already changed.\u00a0 Almost everybody has already changed.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the Gulf of America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd earlier this month, I signed an order banning men from women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And that\u2019s why, when somebody wants to do that \u2014 when somebody wants to do that \u2014 and even the NCAA has already complied.\u00a0 And they have sent us a letter.\u00a0 They have fully complied with that.\u00a0\n\nI also proudly banned the use of puberty blockers, hormone injections \u2014 you believe this? \u2014 and other chemical and surgical mutilations of all minor youth.\u00a0 Do you believe you have to say that?\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s terrible.\u00a0\n\nWho would believe that we were talking about even these things.\u00a0 Men playing in \u2014 10 years ago, 15 years ago, can you imagine?\u00a0 People would say, \u201cIs he crazy, talking about this?\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re still fighting us, but let them fight.\u00a0 As I said, we\u2019re going to make universal school choice a very big, strong thing.\u00a0 School choice.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we\u2019re working very, very hard to send these schools and education back to the states where they can be properly run.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In other words, this really affects the people in this room.\u00a0\n\nBut you\u2019re going to be running your schools, and who can do worse?\u00a0 Look, they rate them in the top 40.\u00a0 So, we just came out with one that we were number 40, but we were number 1 in cost per pupil.\u00a0\n\nAnd, I mean, I know a lot of the governors in this room.\u00a0 You run a great state, and you\u2019ll do great with education at a much lower price \u2014 we\u2019re going to give you whatever you need \u2014 but at a much lower price.\n\nWe have people in Washington, D.C., that, in all fairness, in many cases, don\u2019t give a damn about your pupils or your students or your states.\u00a0 And they\u2019re running everything, and they\u2019re running it into the ground. \u00a0\n\nSo, it came out we\u2019re last in education but first in cost per pupil.\u00a0 Norway; Denmark; Sweden; I have to tell you, China; and a few others are always in the top five.\u00a0 And I really believe that 35 or 36 states and all of you are here \u2014 almost all of you here representing those states, I think you\u2019re going to have education that\u2019s every bit as good as Norway and Denmark and Sweden and all of them.\u00a0\n\nAnd then we\u2019ll have some laggards.\u00a0 And you know who the laggards are going to be.\u00a0 You just have to look at everything else.\u00a0\n\nBut in everything we do, we\u2019re putting America first, because the Republican Party is now known as the party of common sense.\u00a0 It\u2019s the party of common sense.\u00a0 Very important.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a very important phrase for you to use.\u00a0 It\u2019s all about common sense.\u00a0 We\u2019re conservative, and, you know, we\u2019re a lot of things, but most important thing is we have to use common sense.\u00a0\n\nThanks in part to the hard work of the people in this room, we\u2019re forging a new political majority that is shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for nearly 100 years.\u00a0\n\nUnder our leadership, the Republican Party has become the proud voice of hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\u00a0 We are a much bigger, much more powerful party.\u00a0 Now is the time for us all to press forward, think big, be bold, and deliver the once-in-a-lifetime reforms our citizens need and really deserve.\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve gone through hell for four years.\u00a0 Some of them don\u2019t even know it.\u00a0 They\u2019ve just been led down a path.\u00a0 They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019ve gone through.\u00a0\n\nAs one team, we can make our borders stronger, our communities safer, our schools better, our families happier, our citizens wealthier, and our country freer, freer, freer and more exceptional than ever before.\u00a0\n\nWe will work together, and we will absolutely, without question, make America great again.\u00a0\n\nGod bless you all.\u00a0 And do a great job.\u00a0 And go home and watch the hockey game.\u00a0 It should be interesting.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Brian.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you. (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8:25 P.M.
