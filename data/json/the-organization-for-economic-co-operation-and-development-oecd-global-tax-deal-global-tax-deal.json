  "summary": "The document is a memorandum issued on January 20, 2025, addressing the United States' position on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Tax Deal. It is intended for key government officials including the Secretary of the Treasury, the United States Trade Representative, and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the OECD. The primary action mandated by the memorandum is to notify the OECD that any commitments previously made by the United States regarding the Global Tax Deal are void unless Congress formally adopts them.\n\nThe memorandum expresses concerns that the Global Tax Deal hampers the United States' sovereignty and economic competitiveness by allowing foreign jurisdiction over American income. It instructs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Trade Representative to take protective measures against foreign tax practices that might adversely affect American companies. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with investigating non-compliance by foreign countries with U.S. tax treaties and preparing a report with recommendations for the President within 60 days.\n\nGeneral provisions of the memorandum ensure that implementation is consistent with applicable laws and appropriations, clarifying that it does not create enforceable rights for any parties. The memorandum aims to recapture national control over tax policies and protect American interests from discriminatory international tax regimes.",
