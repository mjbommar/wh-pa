and\n\n(iii) \u00a0\u201cgender ideology,\u201d as defined in section 3(b) of this order.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Department of Defense and the Armed Forces shall not hire employees, contractors, or consultants to teach the theories set forth in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall carefully review the leadership, curriculum, and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions associated with their respective Departments to ensure alignment with this order. \u00a0In addition, these institutions shall be required to teach that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0Implementation*.* \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue detailed guidance for the implementation of this order to their respective departments within 30 days of the date of this order.\n\n(b) \u00a0Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report through the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy documenting the progress of their respective Departments in implementing this order, and any recommendations for action to fulfill the objectives of this order.\n\nSec. 8.\u00a0 Severability.\u00a0 If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\u00a0\n\nSec. 9. \u00a0General Provisions*.*\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof;

  "summary": "# Summary\n\nOn January 27, 2025, a new presidential order was issued by the president of the United States. This executive order mandates the elimination of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the Armed Forces and related departments, such as the Department of Defense and Homeland Security. The president emphasizes meritocracy and aims to remove any race- or sex-based discrimination within these establishments, asserting that such practices undermine unit cohesion and military readiness. \n\nThe policy outlined in this order calls for an abolition of all DEI offices and related programs. It mandates an internal review by the Department of Defense to identify and document prior DEI initiatives and instances of discrimination. Further, the order prohibits the teaching or promotion of divisive concepts, race, or sex stereotyping within the military and associated educational institutions. Additionally, the measure requires comprehensive guidance and progress reports from relevant departments to ensure effective implementation.\n",
