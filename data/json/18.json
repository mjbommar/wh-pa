  "summary": "The page from the White House website lists a series of recent Presidential Actions dated January 20, 2025. These actions cover a broad range of topics that are significant for both domestic and international policy. The list includes the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization and measures to address concerns over foreign applications like TikTok. In addition, the President has issued pardons and commutations related to the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Furthermore, actions are focused on putting America first in environmental agreements, and there are efforts to deliver relief from living costs, implement hiring and regulatory freezes, promote in-person work, and address federal censorship and the perceived weaponization of the federal government.\n\nEach entry links to a detailed description of the action on the White House website, highlighting the administration's priorities upon assuming office. These actions reflect a shift in policy direction intended to assert national interests more prominently, manage domestic socioeconomic issues, and reform federal governance. The page navigates through whitehouse.gov with pagination options to explore more such updates and announcements.",
  "eli5": "The President has made lots of new rules about how the country deals with important things like keeping jobs in America, spending money wisely, and being careful with tech stuff from other countries. There are also new rules about how people in government should work and talk.",
