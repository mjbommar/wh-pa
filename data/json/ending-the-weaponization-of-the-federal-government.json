or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 20, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "The document, dated January 20, 2025, outlines a presidential order aimed at ending the perceived weaponization of the federal government by the previous administration. It asserts that the former administration used federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target political opponents, interfere with democratic processes, and suppress free speech. This order sets forth a process to hold accountable those involved in such actions.\n\nTo achieve this, the current administration mandates the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to review the past activities of relevant agencies over the last four years. They are tasked with identifying misconduct contrary to the objectives of this order, particularly instances where civil or criminal enforcement actions were politically motivated. Reports are to be prepared with recommendations for remedial measures. This process underscores a commitment to document retention policies and legal compliance.\n\nThe order clarifies that it should not negate existing legal authority or budgetary roles and does not create new legal rights for individuals. Any implementation must comply with existing laws and budgetary constraints.",
