  "summary": "On March 1, 2025, a presidential order was issued designating English as the official language of the United States. This action, taken by the President, aims to unify the nation by encouraging the use of a single language for communication, rooted in the historical use of English in foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The order revokes Executive Order 13166, which was focused on improving access to services for those with limited English proficiency, but does not require changes to the services provided by any agency.\n\nAgencies retain the discretion to continue offering services and producing documents in languages other than English if deemed necessary for their operations. The Attorney General is directed to rescind related guidance documents and provide new guidelines consistent with the new order. The order stresses that it should not affect existing legal authorities or impede agency functions, and does not intend to create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.",
  "eli5": "The President decided that everyone in the U.S. should use English as the main language to help us understand each other better. This means government things like forms and signs will mostly be in English, but they can still use other languages if needed.",
