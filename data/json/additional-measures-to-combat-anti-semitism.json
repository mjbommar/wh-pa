denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault. \u00a0A\u00a0joint report by the House Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Oversight and Accountability, Veterans\u2019 Affairs, and Ways and Means calls the Federal Government\u2019s failure to fight anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students \u201castounding.\u201d \u00a0This failure is unacceptable and ends today.Sec. 2.\u00a0 Policy.\u00a0 It shall be the policy of the United\u00a0States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously, using all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.Sec. 3. \u00a0Additional Measures to Combat Campus Anti-Semitism. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 Within 60 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department or agency (agency) shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, identifying all civil and criminal authorities or actions within the jurisdiction of that agency, beyond those already implemented under Executive Order 13899, that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.(b)\u00a0 The report submitted by the Attorney General under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all court cases, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism and indicate whether the Attorney General intends to or has taken any action with respect to such matters, including filing statements of interest or intervention.(c)\u00a0 The Attorney General is encouraged to employ appropriate civil-rights enforcement authorities, such as 18 U.S.C. 241, to combat anti-Semitism.\u00a0(d) \u00a0The report submitted by the Secretary of Education under this section shall additionally include an inventory and an analysis of all Title VI complaints and administrative actions, including in K-12 education, related to anti-Semitism \u2014 pending or resolved after October 7, 2023 \u2014 within the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.(e) \u00a0In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.Sec. 4.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n",
  "summary": "This document outlines an order issued by the President of the United States on January 29, 2025, aimed at combating anti-Semitism, especially in educational institutions. The order reaffirms the initiatives previously laid out in Executive Order 13899, initially issued on December 11, 2019. This reaffirmation was deemed necessary due to a significant increase in anti-Semitic acts following the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. The order mandates federal departments to utilize their jurisdictions to form strategies combating anti-Semitism in educational settings and encourages the use of appropriate legal tools against such acts.\n\nIt requires heads of executive departments to report on civil and criminal authorities that could help curb anti-Semitism and also to inventory and analyze cases pending against institutions of higher learning related to post-October 7, 2023, anti-Semitic incidents. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Education are specifically tasked with assessing court cases and Title VI complaints respectively. The Secretary of State, Secretary of Education, and Secretary of Homeland Security are to provide institutes of higher education with guidelines for monitoring activities of non-citizen students that may contravene U.S. laws. The order emphasizes implementation within the bounds of the law and the available budget.",
