Trump Protects the States and the American People by Closing the Border to Illegals via Proclamation\t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 22, 2025\n\nGUARANTEEING THE STATES PROTECTION AGAINST INVASION: Today, President Trump signed an Executive Order that suspends the physical entry of aliens engaged in an invasion of the United States through the southern border.\n    - In joining the Union, the States agreed to surrender much of their sovereignty in exchange for the federal government\u2019s promise in Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, to \u201cprotect each of [the States] against Invasion.\u201d\u00a0\n    - States, such as the Great State of Texas, have asked the Federal Government for protection against invasion during the Biden Administration, but it failed to protect them from millions of illegal aliens entering the United States, invading their communities, and imposing billions of dollars of costs upon State and local governments.\n    - The President has the authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, to prevent the physical entry of illegal aliens into the United States across the southern border.\n\nDIRECTION TO IMMEDIATELY REPEL, REPATRIATE, AND REMOVE ILLEGAL ALIENS INVOLVED IN AN INVASION:\n    - Through the exercise of his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Constitution of the United States, President Trump is authorizing and directing the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State to take all necessary action to immediately repel, repatriate, and remove illegal aliens across the southern border of the United States.\n    - Through the exercise of his authority, President Trump has further restricted access to the provisions of the immigration laws that would enable any illegal alien involved in an invasion across the southern border of the United States to remain in the United States, such as asylum.\n\nPROMISES KEPT: In 2024, President Trump promised to \u201cseal the border on Day 1.\u201d\n    - As President Trump described in 2018: \u201cIllegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year\u2026And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n",
  "summary": "On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aiming to protect United States borders by preventing the entry of illegal aliens perceived as an invasion through the southern border. This action is rooted in the federal government's constitutional obligation under Article IV, Section 4 to protect states from invasion. The Executive Order authorizes federal departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, and State, to take necessary actions in repelling and deporting these aliens. Concurrently, it limits their ability to access legal immigration remedies like asylum.\n\nThe order underscores President Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign vow to fortify national borders, citing that illegal immigration significantly impacts American lives by affecting jobs, taxpayer resources, and public safety. The directive asserts the President's rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act and Article II of the Constitution to enforce these immigration measures and challenges the previous administration\u2019s perceived inadequacies in addressing illegal immigration.",
  "eli5": "President Trump made a rule to stop people from coming into the U.S. without permission, especially from the southern border, because he says it costs the country money and creates problems. He told government workers to make sure these people are sent back if they try to come in.",
