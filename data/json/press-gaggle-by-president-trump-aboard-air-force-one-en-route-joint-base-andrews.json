EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0 Hello.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hello.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0\n\nSo, you just saw this.\u00a0 (The president holds up a USA Today article entitled \u201cHow America voted, which counties shifted toward Trump and a look at voter turnout.\u201d)\u00a0 This just came out, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s quite good.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 By any standard, that\u2019s quite good.\u00a0\n\nI shouldn\u2019t leave USA \u2014 is anybody here from USA Today?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday, we had someone from \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yesterday.\u00a0 We missed him.\u00a0\n\nDoes everybody know Steven Cheung?\u00a0 He\u2019s a sweetheart.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t want to get in a fight with him, right?\n\nAnyway, what\u2019s up?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the TikTok deal, any developments there?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, there\u2019s a lot of people interested in TikTok, and I think we have a chance of doing something good.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be speaking to China about that also, because they\u2019re a party to it, obviously.\u00a0 But it would be great to keep TikTok alive, sell it to somebody that\u2019s going to do a great job with it.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you see the CEO today at the event, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did I what?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you see the CEO today at the event?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t speak to him.\u00a0 Was he there?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was supposed to be there.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think so, yeah, but I did not see him.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, Elon Musk is proposing potentially giving money to Americans based on what DOGE is finding. \u00a0Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I love it.\u00a0 A 20 percent dividend, so to speak, for the money that we\u2019re saving by going after the waste and fraud and abuse and all of the other things that are happening.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a great idea.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How much money do you think Americans \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It could be a lot.\u00a0 I mean, if it\u2019s 20 percent, we\u2019d give back a lot of money to the taxpayer.\u00a0 And also, it\u2019d give an incentive for the taxpayer to go out and report things to us where we can save money.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you signed an immigration-related executive order today.\u00a0 Ho- \u2014 what do you think of ICE arrests right now?\u00a0 Do you think that they need to increase the number of people they\u2019re arresting \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 increase the \u2014 the pace of the ICE arrests?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I think they\u2019re doing a great job.\u00a0 You know, you have people that are hiding.\u00a0 They are professionals at hiding.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done for a big part of their lives.\u00a0\n\nAnd they\u2019re criminals.\u00a0 In many cases, very serious criminals, including murderers.\u00a0 And, obviously, they\u2019re not easy to capture, but they\u2019re being captured in record numbers, and they\u2019re being brought out of our country, being brought back to where they came from.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Boeing.\u00a0 You mentioned maybe taking a different route.\u00a0 What would a different route entail?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 On what?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Boeing, with the Air Force One plane.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I\u2019m not happy with Boeing.\u00a0 It takes them a long time to do \u2014\n\nYou know, Air Force One, we gave that contract out a long time ago.\u00a0 It was a fixed-price contract, and I\u2019m not happy with the fact that it\u2019s taking so long.\u00a0 And we may do something else.\u00a0 We may go out and buy a plane or get a plane or something, but I\u2019m not happy with the fact that it\u2019s taken Boeing so long.\u00a0 There no excuse for it.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nAnd, you know, they had a fixed-price contract.\u00a0 I made that deal, and now they \u2014 supposedly, they\u2019re losing a lot of money and they\u2019d like to see if they could, you know, up the price.\u00a0 But I make fixed-price deals.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like time and material deals.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, the only other commercial aircraft maker that could make a plane that big is Airbus.\u00a0 Would you consider buying a \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I would not consider Airbus over Boeing, no.\u00a0 But I could buy one that was used and convert it.\u00a0 I could buy one from another country, perhaps, or get one from another country.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re looking at other alternatives, because it\u2019s taking Boeing too long.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nYou know, they were supposed to be finished, like, years ago.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Years ago.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, and you \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget, I signed that contract during my term, and it was a very good contract.\u00a0 And I took, like, a billion six off the price, and it was supposed to be done, you know, quickly, and it\u2019s a long time.\u00a0 Right?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you push for your preferred color scheme for Air Force One?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, no, it\u2019s going to be that color, yeah.\u00a0 No matter what, it\u2019s going to be for that color.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, about Gaza.\u00a0 Do you e- \u2014 do you find the Egyptian proposal to redevelop Gaza acceptable?\u00a0 And does that change your \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen it.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen it.\u00a0 When I see it, I\u2019ll let you know.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, can I you about Ukraine?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You \u2014 you said today that you had a deal on critical minerals, and Ukraine broke it.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, we had a deal where we were going to get \u2014 look, you have to understand, Europe is being paid back the money that they put up, and they\u2019re only putting up a fraction of what we\u2019re putting up.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re in for $100 billion, and we\u2019re in for $350 billion.\u00a0 There\u2019s no reason that should have happened.\u00a0 It\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault.\u00a0 He shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen.\u00a0\n\nBut on top of it all, they\u2019re getting their $100 billion back, and we\u2019re not.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been talking about this for two years.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou have to loan them the money so that if things work out, they\u2019re going to pay you back.\u201d\u00a0 And they didn\u2019t do that.\u00a0 So, Biden didn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 It\u2019s his fault.\u00a0 Nobody has ever seen anything so stupid.\u00a0\n\nSo, Europe gets their money back, and they\u2019re only in for a small fraction.\u00a0 And, obviously, everything is important, but it\u2019s more important for them because they\u2019re right next to Russia.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s more important than \u2014 we have an ocean in between us.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s obviously more important to the European countries than it is to the U.S.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, we don\u2019t get our money back.\u00a0 And we told them that the deal is we\u2019ll do something for the rare earth and some oil, et cetera, et cetera, and that would be all right.\u00a0 And they agreed to it, more or less.\u00a0\n\nAnd then Scott Bessent actually went there and was treated rather rudely, because \u2014 essentially, they told him no, and Zelenskyy was sleeping and unavailable to meet him.\u00a0 He traveled many hours on the train, which is a dangerous trip.\u00a0 And we\u2019re talking about the secretary of the Treasury.\u00a0 He went there to get a document signed.\u00a0 And when he got there, he came back empty.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t sign the document.\u00a0\n\nBut for Europe, they pay back their money.\u00a0 It\u2019s a loan.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 And we should\u2019ve had a loan, too, but we had an administration that was incompetent.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you resurrect that deal?\u00a0 Is there anything that you can do?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I think I\u2019m going to resurrect it, or, you know, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 But I\u2019m going to resurrect it, or things are not going to make him too happy.\u00a0\n\nAnd, look, it\u2019s time for elections.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t had an election in a long time.\u00a0 It\u2019s wonderful to say, \u201cYou know, we can\u2019t have an election.\u201d\u00a0 But it\u2019s time for elections.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also time to find out what happened with all the money, because he made the statement that half of it he doesn\u2019t know where it is or something like that.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to find out: All the money that we\u2019ve been sending to Ukraine, where is it?\n\nAnd I can tell you we\u2019re doing very well with Russia.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do something with Russia that he was unable to do.\u00a0 We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing of, you know, potentially additional millions of people.\u00a0 The soldiers are being just wiped out on both sides.\u00a0 Wiped out.\u00a0 It\u2019s horrible.\u00a0\n\nYou know, the weaponry today is so powerful, so, you know, strong that it\u2019s killing a lot of soldiers.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t want to sol- \u2014 they\u2019re Russian and they\u2019re Ukrainian.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see those soldiers killed.\u00a0 They have mothers and fathers.\u00a0 They have sisters and brothers.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see them killed.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on tariffs, you mentioned lumber.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve heard before.\u00a0 Any specific \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Lumber, yeah.\u00a0 Forest \u2014 forest product, yeah.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And do you have a rate in mind for that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, but we\u2019re thinking about maybe 25 percent.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And would that also be April 2nd?\u00a0 On or before April 2nd?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 In that vicinity, yeah.\u00a0 A little bit later.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And also, which car companies did you \u2014 you said that you spoke with some car companies.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I spoke to all car companies.\u00a0 Everybody is coming back into America.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, these are foreign car companies?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Including foreign companies, yeah.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to be coming in, because they don\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said you\u2019ll be having lunch with some Democrats next week.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you elaborate on who that is and what you all plan to discuss?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019ll see when I do it, but some good ones.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Some biggies.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you con- \u2014 are you concerned about congressional funding?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I\u2019m just \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is that on the table?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to just talk.\u00a0\n\nI think it would be great if Republicans and Democrats could get along.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\u00a0 It makes sense.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, would you say you trust the Russians to negotiate in good faith going forward?\u00a0 Do you trust them?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 I think the Russians want to see the war end.\u00a0 And I do.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 But I think they have the cards a little bit, because, you know, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019ve taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, have you set a date for the British prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be coming soon, though.\u00a0 He has asked to come and see me.\u00a0 So, he\u2019ll be coming.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about Macron?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And president of France also.\u00a0 Macron will be coming.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But no set dates yet?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Very soon.\u00a0 Maybe Monday.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on congestion pricing.\u00a0 So \u2014 they\u2019re going to be \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to have saved about \u2014 or raised about $15 billion to help the MTA.\u00a0 Do you have an alternative way that \u2014 to fund the MTA system now that there won\u2019t be cong- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, that\u2019s up to New York.\u00a0 They have to do that.\u00a0\n\nLook, New York has treated a lot of people very badly.\u00a0 And it\u2019s hard to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s hard to feel sorry for what\u2019s happened in New York.\u00a0 It\u2019s sad to see the way they\u2019ve treated people, and they continue to do it.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, look at what\u2019s going on with the mayor.\u00a0 Look at what\u2019s going on with so many other things.\u00a0 So, congestion pricing is not a good situation, and they\u2019re treating the people of New York very badly.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s a \u2014 supposing you worked in a shoe shop or you worked in a restaurant as a waiter, and you have to come into Manhattan, and they\u2019re taking, you know, many, many dollars out of your pocket.\u00a0 You can\u2019t afford to do it.\u00a0\n\nAnd price \u2014 you know, you \u2014 if you take a look, traffic will go down because people aren\u2019t going to come.\u00a0 If people don\u2019t come, that means the whole place is \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u00a0\n\nSo, it could be, and it\u2019s probably going to show that.\u00a0 Traffic will come down, but that means they\u2019re not going to spend their money in New York.\u00a0 They\u2019ll go someplace else.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) prepared to go to court if lawsuits ensue?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 You could give me the final, because I haven\u2019t seen it as of late today because I was making a speech.\u00a0\n\nDid I make a good speech?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\n\nOkay.\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 What else?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I ask you about the Chinese?\u00a0 So, you know, eventually, you would like to meet with President Xi.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we heard \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I have very good relationship with President Xi.\u00a0 I think a great relationship with President Xi.\u00a0 But remember, he loves China, and I love the USA.\u00a0 So, you know, right there, there\u2019s a little bit of competitiveness.\u00a0 But the relationship I have with President Xi is, I would say, a great one.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We heard that you \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was obviously hurt by COVID coming in.\u00a0 It hurt them, hurt us, hurt everybody.\u00a0 Hurt the whole world.\u00a0 But outside of that, I have a very, very good relationship with President Xi.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you looking to make a new trade deal?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think he\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s a very unique person.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you make a new trade deal with China?\u00a0 I mean, you know, the \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s possible.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One trade deal never really got \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s possible.\u00a0\n\nWell, we did a great trade deal with China.\u00a0 We did it \u2014 great for the farmers, great for manufacturers.\u00a0 They had to buy 50 billion dollars\u2019 worth of our product, and we were making them buy it.\u00a0 The problem is that Biden didn\u2019t push them to adhere to it.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you think D.C. should govern itself, or do you think that governing of District of Columbia should go back to Congress?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think that we should govern District of Columbia.\u00a0 It\u2019s so important, the D.C. situation.\u00a0 I think that we should run it strong, run it with law and order, make it absolutely flawlessly beautiful.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think we should take over Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Make it safe.\u00a0 People are getting killed.\u00a0 People are being hurt.\u00a0 You have great police department there, but, somehow, they\u2019re not utilized properly.\u00a0\n\nWe should govern D.C.\u00a0 I think the federal government should take over the governance of D.C. and run it really, really properly.\u00a0\n\nAnd I like the mayor.\u00a0 I get along great with the mayor, but they\u2019re not doing the job.\u00a0 Too much crime.\u00a0 Too much graffiti.\u00a0 Too many tents on the lawns of these magnificent lawns, and there\u2019s tents.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a sad thing.\u00a0 You know, homeless people all over the place, and we got to take care of the homeless.\u00a0 But you can\u2019t have that in Washington, D.C.\n\nYou know, when they come over to see me \u2014 like Macron is coming and the prime minister of UK is coming and all these people are coming over to see me \u2014 we\u2019ll have, ultimately, President Xi, and we\u2019ll have everybody

  "summary": "### Summary\n\nOn February 19, 2025, President Trump conducted a press gaggle aboard Air Force One while en route to Joint Base Andrews. During the session, he discussed various topics, including the TikTok acquisition, asserting that there's interest in keeping the app alive and potentially selling it to a suitable company. He also expressed dissatisfaction with Boeing over delays related to the Air Force One project and contemplated alternatives, although he ruled out switching to Airbus planes. Additionally, Trump commented on his plans to engage with Democrats for potential bipartisan cooperation and highlighted ongoing issues with immigration enforcement.\n\nRegarding international matters, Trump criticized the existing financial arrangements with Ukraine, suggesting that the U.S. should have negotiated a loan rather than direct financial aid and mentioned dissatisfaction over an unfulfilled deal on critical minerals. He also addressed the need for a national security-driven engagement with Greenland and expressed interest in a potential deal with Russia to end the conflict involving Ukraine. Presidential trips and potential trade deals with China were also on the agenda, with Trump maintaining a positive view of his relationship with President Xi.\n\nOn domestic issues, he raised concerns about congestion pricing in New York, stating it could harm local businesses and affect traffic adversely. He also criticized the governance of Washington D.C., suggesting a federal intervention to address crime and homelessness issues. Trump concluded by addressing tariff strategies and fiscal policies, reaffirming plans to ensure the integrity of Fort Knox and extract efficiencies from the Department of Defense's budget through DOGE (Deficiency Obligation Governance Efficiency).",
