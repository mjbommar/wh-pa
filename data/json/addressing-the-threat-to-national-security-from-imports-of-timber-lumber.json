impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,\u201d as well as other relevant factors, including:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the current and projected demand for timber and lumber in the United States;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0the extent to which domestic production of timber and lumber can meet domestic demand;\n\n(iii) \u00a0the role of foreign supply chains, particularly of major exporters, in meeting United States timber and lumber demand;\n\n(iv) \u00a0\u00a0the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices on United States timber, lumber, and derivative product industry competitiveness;\n\n(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the feasibility of increasing domestic timber and lumber capacity to reduce imports; and\n\n(vi) \u00a0\u00a0the impact of current trade policies on domestic timber, lumber, and derivative product production, and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\n\nSec.\u00a03. \u00a0Required Actions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products.\n\n(b) \u00a0No later than 270 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0findings on whether imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products threaten national security;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and\n\n(iii) \u00a0policy recommendations for strengthening the United States timber and lumber supply chain through strategic investments and permitting reforms.\n\nSec.\u00a04. \u00a0Definitions.\u00a0 As used in this order:\n\n(a) \u00a0The term \u201ctimber\u201d refers to wood that has not been processed.\n\n(b) \u00a0The term \u201clumber\u201d refers to wood that has been processed, including wood that has been milled and cut into boards or planks.\n\nSec.\u00a05. \u00a0General Provisions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 March 1, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "### Summary\n\nOn March 1, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to address the challenges posed by imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products on national security. The wood products industry is critical to both economic strength and industrial resilience in the United States, supporting vital civilian and military construction efforts. Despite having the capacity to meet domestic demand, the US has been a net importer of lumber since 2016, largely due to foreign subsidies and import dumping, which threaten the domestic market.\n\nThe executive order mandates the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the impact of foreign imports on national security, focusing on aspects such as domestic production capacity, foreign supply chain roles, and trade practices. It requires consultation with various departments, including Defense, and the submission of a report within 270 days detailing security threats and recommended measures to strengthen domestic production. This may include tariffs, export controls, and strategic investments, underscoring the importance of a resilient domestic timber and lumber supply chain.",
