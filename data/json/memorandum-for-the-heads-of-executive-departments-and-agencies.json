  "summary": "The memorandum, dated February 6, 2025, is from the President of the United States to the heads of executive departments and agencies. It addresses the issue of U.S. government funding to Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) that allegedly impact the nation's security, prosperity, or safety negatively. The memorandum emphasizes that it is the Administration's policy to cease funding NGOs that do not align with national interests.\n\nTo implement this policy, the heads of all agencies are instructed to thoroughly review current and future funding activities regarding NGOs. This review must ensure that such funding decisions are aligned with the Administration's expressed goals and priorities, and that they comply with authorizing statutes, regulations, and other informed judgments by agency heads.",
