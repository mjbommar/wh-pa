Trump signed an Executive Order ensuring lawful governance and implementing the President\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) deregulatory initiative. The Executive Order will end Federal overreach in regulation and enforcement and restore the constitutional separation of powers:\n    - Agency heads shall, in coordination with their DOGE team leads and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), review all regulations subject to their jurisdiction for consistency with law and Trump Administration policy, prioritizing rules that impose heavy costs.       - A Unified Agenda will be developed to rescind and/or modify regulations that are inconsistent with law or the Trump Administration\u2019s policy. \n    - Agencies shall utilize enforcement discretion to de-prioritize enforcement actions that stretch statutory authority or exceed the constitutional powers of the Federal Government.\n    - The Order exempts, among other things, any action respecting a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States.\n\n**ELIMINATING UNLAWFUL REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT:**The accumulation of federal regulations and their burdensome enforcement, including legally suspect regulations, has stifled economic growth and constrained Americans\u2019 freedom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    - The Biden Administration imposed a historic $1.7 trillion in costs on the American people.\u00a0\n    - This Executive Order stops and reverses the regulatory overreach and abusive enforcement, ensuring that the operation of the government is responsible, lawful, and efficient.\n\n**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump\u2019s first term was the most successful deregulatory undertaking in American history. This Executive Order builds on these foundations and furthers the deregulatory project to improve the daily lives of the American people and unleash a new Golden Age of America.\n",
