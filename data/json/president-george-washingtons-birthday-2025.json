TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 17, 2025, as a reserved holiday commemorating George Washington\u2019s Birthday.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\nseventeenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two\u00a0thousand\u00a0twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United\u00a0States of\u00a0America the two\u00a0hundred and forty-ninth.\n",
