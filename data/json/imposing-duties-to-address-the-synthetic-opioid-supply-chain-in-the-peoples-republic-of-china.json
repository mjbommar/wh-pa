(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50\u00a0U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section\u00a0301 of\u00a0title\u00a03, United States Code,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of synthetic opioids has profound consequences on our Nation, including by killing approximately two hundred Americans per day, putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, ravaging our communities, and destroying our families. \u00a0Synthetic opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for people aged 18 to 45 in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During my first term, I took steps to end the direct flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to the United States. \u00a0Since then, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which exerts ultimate control over the government and enterprises of the PRC, has subsidized and otherwise incentivized PRC chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Furthermore, the PRC provides support to and safe haven for PRC-origin transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids.\u00a0 These PRC-origin TCOs coordinate and communicate using PRC social media software applications in the conduct of their business.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Many\u00a0PRC-based chemical companies also go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in the flow of legitimate commerce.\u00a0 Some of the techniques employed by these PRC-based companies to conceal the true contents of the parcels and the identity of the distributors include the use of re-shippers in the United States, false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging.\u00a0\u00a0 While more than 500,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the southern border each of the last 3 fiscal years, in addition, more than 42,000 pounds of drugs have been seized at the northern border each year on average over the last 3 years.\u00a0 Illicit drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The influx of these drugs to our Nation threatens the fabric of our society. \u00a0The PRC plays a central role in this challenge, not merely by failing to stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the United States, but by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the United States through illicit distribution networks has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States), and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite multiple attempts to resolve this crisis at its root source through bilateral dialogue, PRC officials have failed to follow through with the decisive actions needed to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down the money laundering TCOs. \u00a0The PRC implements the most sophisticated domestic surveillance network coupled with the most comprehensive domestic law enforcement apparatus in the world.\u00a0 The PRC also routinely exerts extraterritorial reach across the globe to threaten, harass, and suppress what it views as political dissent.\u00a0 As such, the CCP does not lack the capacity to severely blunt the global illicit opioid epidemic; it simply is unwilling to do so.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Immediate action is required to address the national emergency I declared and to finally end this emergency, including the public health crisis caused by opioid use and addiction, which will not happen until the full compliance and cooperation of the PRC government is assured.I hereby determine and order:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Section 1.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens.\u00a0 I\u00a0will not stand by and allow our citizens to be poisoned, our laws to be trampled, our communities to be ravaged, or our families to be destroyed.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886.\u00a0 Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that proclamation to cover the failure of the PRC government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other TCOs, criminals at large, and drugs.\u00a0 In addition, this failure to act constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\u00a0 I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat.\u00a0 This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC as set forth in this order.\u00a0 In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sec. 2. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 All articles that are products of the PRC, as defined by the *Federal Register* notice described in section 2(d) of this order (the *Federal Register* notice), shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty. \u00a0Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security as specified in the *Federal Register* notice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 Should the PRC retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to the PRC or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this Executive Order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of the PRC, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate the objectives of this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the *Federal Register*.\u00a0 The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsection 2(a) of this section, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e) \u00a0Articles that are products of the PRC, except those that are eligible for admission under \u201cdomestic status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsection 2(a) of this section, must be admitted as \u201cprivileged foreign status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.\u00a0 Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone*.*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(f)\u00a0 No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(g)\u00a0 For avoidance of doubt, duty-free *de minimis* treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) of this section.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other presidential directive or guidance related to trade with the PRC that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The articles described in subsection (a) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sec. 3.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Attorney General, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation regarding the PRC.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the PRC government has taken adequate steps to alleviate the opioid crisis through cooperative actions.\u00a0 Upon the President\u2019s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order will be removed.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the PRC fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sec. 4.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0 All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sec. 5.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Attorney General, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sec. 6.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of\u00a0Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United\u00a0States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.THE WHITE HOUSE,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 February 1, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On February 1, 2025, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, issued measures to combat the synthetic opioid crisis by imposing additional import duties on products from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The President justified this action by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and other relevant U.S. laws due to the PRC's alleged role in the proliferation of synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl, into the United States. The opioid crisis has been declared a national emergency, posing significant threats to public health, national security, and the economy.\n\nThe new tariffs include a 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty on articles produced in China, effective February 4, 2025. These tariffs are part of a broader strategy to pressure the PRC to curtail the export of opioid precursors and disrupt transnational criminal organizations involved in the drug trade. Should China retaliate, the President reserves the right to increase or broaden these tariffs. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with monitoring the situation and reporting any changes in PRC's actions to the President to decide whether the tariffs should be revoked or continued.\n\nThe order emphasizes that previous actions through diplomatic channels have been insufficient and underscores that the PRC, despite having the capability to significantly reduce the illicit opioid trade, has failed to take necessary steps. As such, the action seeks not only to address the immediate crisis but also to initiate continued monitoring and potentially further actions, as may be necessary, to achieve substantial relief from the opioid epidemic.",
