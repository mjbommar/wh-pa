Trump Takes Action to Enhance America\u2019s AI Leadership\t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 23, 2025\n\nREMOVING BARRIERS TO AMERICAN AI INNOVATION: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order eliminating harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhancing America\u2019s global AI dominance.\n    - President Trump is fulfilling his promise to revoke Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation and imposes onerous and unnecessary government control over the development of AI.\n    - The Biden AI Executive Order established unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.\n    - Today\u2019s executive order:       - Revokes the Biden AI Executive Order which hampered the private sector\u2019s ability to innovate in AI by imposing government control over AI development and deployment.\n      - Calls for departments and agencies to revise or rescind all policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other actions taken under the Biden AI order that are inconsistent with enhancing America\u2019s leadership in AI. \n\nENHANCING AMERICA\u2019S AI LEADERSHIP: The United States must act decisively to retain leadership in AI and enhance our economic and national security.\n    - This Executive Order establishes the commitment of the United States to sustain and enhance America\u2019s dominance in AI to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\n    - American development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. With the right government policies, the United States can solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.       - The order directs the development of an AI Action Plan to sustain and enhance America\u2019s AI dominance, led by the Assistant to the President for Science &amp; Technology, the White House AI &amp; Crypto Czar, and the National Security Advisor.\n      - It further directs the White House to revise and reissue OMB AI memoranda to departments and agencies on the Federal Government\u2019s acquisition and governance of AI to ensure that harmful barriers to America\u2019s AI leadership are eliminated. \n\nCONTINUING PRIORITIZATION OF AI: President Trump has made American leadership in AI a priority and is now building on his actions during his first administration.\n    - President Trump signed the first-ever Executive Order on AI in 2019 recognizing the paramount importance of American AI leadership to the economic and national security of the United States.       - In historic actions, the Trump Administration committed to  doubling AI research investment , established the first-ever  national AI research institutes , strengthened American leadership in  AI technical standards , and issued the world\u2019s first  AI regulatory guidance  to govern AI development in the private sector. \n    - President Trump also took executive action in 2020 to establish the first-ever guidance for Federal agency adoption of AI to more effectively deliver services to the American people and foster public trust in this critical technology.\n    - Today\u2019s Executive Order builds upon these past successes and clears a path for the United States to act decisively to retain leadership in AI, rooted in free speech and human flourishing.\n",
  "summary": "On January 23, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at enhancing America's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). This action revokes an existing Executive Order from the Biden Administration, which Trump claims imposed restrictions on AI research and development that were harmful to innovation and detrimental to America's technological leadership. Trump's new directive seeks to dismantle these barriers and to empower private sector growth in AI by asking governmental departments and agencies to amend any policies that do not align with this objective.\n\nThe Executive Order stresses the United States' commitment to retaining dominance in AI to boost economic competitiveness and national security. President Trump directs the creation of an AI Action Plan, led by key White House officials, to ensure America remains at the forefront of AI advancement. Additionally, it requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to update federal AI acquisition guidelines to eliminate hindrances to AI progress in the country.\n\nThis order continues President Trump's ongoing efforts, dating back to his first term, to prioritize AI development. Previously, his administration focused on doubling investment in AI research, establishing national AI research institutes, and formulating AI regulatory guidance. This latest Executive Order builds on these initiatives with the aim to uphold free speech and support human flourishing in the context of advancing AI technologies.",
