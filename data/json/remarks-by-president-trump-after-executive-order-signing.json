EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I want to thank some of the great people from the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u00a0 They\u2019re here to take photographs, and it\u2019s my honor to do so.\u00a0 Also, the fire department, the great firefighters.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re here throughout the room, and I want to thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be with you in a little while.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do some great photos.\u00a0 We have plenty of time.\u00a0\n\nPolicemen, policewomen, and firemen, firewomen \u2014 they\u2019re here, and we appreciate it very much.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u00a0\n\nOh, I think it\u2019s very important to state that incredible things are happening in our country.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve made more progress in three weeks than they\u2019ve made in four years, especially with respect to the reputation of our country, and people are respecting us again as a country and as a powerful country and maybe a smart country.\n\nBut maybe not so smart, because when you look at some of the waste, fraud, and abuse that\u2019s being inco- \u2014 uncovered by DOGE and the people at DOGE \u2014 these are young \u2014 often young but super brilliant people, incredible computer scientists and other things.\u00a0 And they\u2019re finding levels of fraud and waste and abuse like, I think, nobody ever thought possible.\u00a0\n\nBut before we do that, I just want to ask Will to come over.\u00a0 We\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve just finished signing some executive orders.\u00a0 And if we could start with that, Will, you might want to come up here and just explain what we did.\u00a0\n\nThank you.\u00a0\n\nMR. SCHARF:\u00a0 Good afternoon, y\u2019all.\u00a0 A short while ago, President Trump signed three \u2014 three items.\u00a0\n\nThe first is an executive order relating to the affordability and availability of in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.\u00a0 These are treatments that have become unaffordable for many Americans or have been unaffordable for many Americans.\u00a0 And the executive order is a directive to the Domestic Policy Council to examine ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable for more Americans.\u00a0\n\nThe second item that we signed was a presidential memorandum imposing radical transparency requirements on government departments and agencies in keeping with President Trump and the administration\u2019s broader commitment to governmental transparency.\u00a0 What this presidential memorandum would do is require \u2014 as waste, fraud, and abuse is uncovered, as programs are canceled, and, ultimately, as taxpayer dollars are saved, this presidential memorandum would require departments and agencies to make all of the details of that freely available to the public.\u00a0\n\nLastly, we have another executive order that President Trump signed relating to independent agencies.\u00a0 This executive order would establish important oversight functions in the Office of Management and Budget and its subsidiary office, OIRA, supervising independent agencies and many of their actions and also reestablishes the long-standing norm that only the president or the attorney general can speak for the United States when stating an opinion as to what the law is.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Will.\n\nThat was the primary purpose of this conference to explain that they are all very important in their own way.\u00a0\n\nFertilization \u2014 I\u2019ve been saying that we\u2019re going to do what we have to do, and I think the women \u2014 and families, husbands \u2014 are very appreciative of it.\u00a0\n\nBut that was it.\u00a0\n\nI do want to say while I\u2019m up here, I\u2019ve been contacted by some of the biggest companies in the world, and because of what we\u2019re doing economically and through tariffs and taxes and incentives, they want to come back into the United States.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be announcing various very large companies \u2014 the biggest, actually.\u00a0 And they\u2019ll be coming back, having to do with chips and having to do also with cars and lots of other things.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to be announcing some very, very big \u2014 very big \u2014 momentous, I think \u2014 momentous decisions are being made by companies all around the world \u2014 the biggest \u2014 and they want to come back into the U.S.\u00a0\n\nCar plants are being canceled in other locations now because they want to build them here.\u00a0 And you read about a couple \u2014 not that I want to mention names or anything \u2014 but you read about a couple of big ones in Mexico just got canceled because they\u2019re going to be building them in the United States.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very simply because of what we\u2019re doing with respect to taxes, tariffs, and incentives.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s a very important thing.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll be seeing this over the next \u2014 probably over the next two years, to be honest, but you\u2019re going to see a lot of it over the next couple of weeks.\u00a0 A lot of big ones are be \u2014 going to be announcing.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, while we\u2019re here, I guess we can take a couple of quick questions.\u00a0\n\nGo ahead, please.\u00a0 Please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, have you decided specifically what the auto tariff rate should be?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I probably will tell you that in \u2014 on April 2nd, but it\u2019ll be in the neighborhood of 25 percent.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what about semiconductors and pharmaceuticals?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019ll be 25 percent and higher, and it\u2019ll go very substantially higher over a course of a year.\u00a0 But we want to give them time to come in, because, as you know, when they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff.\u00a0 So, we want to give them a little bit of a chance.\u00a0\n\nYes, thank you.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just following up on that.\u00a0 The EU \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 Andrea Shalal.\u00a0 The EU representative is going to be here in Washington next week \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, tomorrow.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be meeting with Hassett and Greer and Lutnick.\u00a0\n\nWhat can the EU do to sort of avoid the reciprocal tariffs that you\u2019ve talked about?\u00a0 And, you know, you\u2019ve talked a lot about the VAT.\u00a0 Do you expect them to reduce that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, they did already, as I understand it, reduce their car tariff all the way down to what we have.\u00a0 And a lot of that will take place, and I think some won\u2019t do it and some will do it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the EU had a 10 percent tax on cars, and now they have a 2.5 percent tax, which is the exact same as us.\u00a0 So, already we\u2019ve saved a tremendous amount.\u00a0 That would be great \u2014 if everybody would do that, then we\u2019d all be on the same playing field.\u00a0 Because essentially, what we\u2019re doing with the tariffs is, you know, they charge us, we charge them.\u00a0 Same amount.\u00a0 And it\u2019s called reciprocal, actually, and whatever they charge us, we\u2019re charging them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, the EU is \u2014 you know, I appreciate that they did this, but, you know, the EU has been very unfair to us.\u00a0 We have a deficit of $350 billion.\u00a0 They don\u2019t take our cars.\u00a0 They don\u2019t take our farm products.\u00a0 They don\u2019t take almost anything.\u00a0 They take very little.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have to straighten that out, and we will.\u00a0 I have no doubt about it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, go ahead, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Can you tell us a little bit more about the Russia talks, your impression of \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 how they went today \u2014\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and if you\u2019re perhaps more confident or less confident of a deal after what happened today?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, much more confident.\u00a0 They were very good.\u00a0 Russia wants to do something.\u00a0 They want to stop the savage barbarianism.\u00a0 I mean, what\u2019s going on over there, it\u2019s \u2014 soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis.\u00a0 It\u2019s ridiculous.\u00a0 And they\u2019re not American soldiers.\u00a0 They\u2019re Russian soldiers and they\u2019re Ukrainian soldiers, largely, although a lot of Koreans have been killed, as you know \u2014 quite a bit of them have been killed.\u00a0 They came over to fight, and a large portion have been wiped out.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we want to end it.\u00a0 It was \u2014 it\u2019s a senseless war.\u00a0 It should have never happened.\u00a0 It would have never happened if I was president.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a shame to see it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I see pictures that you don\u2019t see, but I see pictures of fields that look hor- \u2014 just horrible.\u00a0 It looks like Gettysburg.\u00a0 If you see the old pictures of Gettysburg, it\u2019s soldiers lying all over the field, body parts all over the field.\u00a0 They\u2019re all dead.\u00a0 And this is going on on a \u2014 on a daily basis.\u00a0 It\u2019s a horrible thing.\u00a0 Both Russia and Ukraine \u2014 they\u2019re losing thousands and thousands of soldiers, and a lot of people have been killed too.\u00a0\n\nI think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019ll \u2014 you\u2019ll see historically and you\u2019ll see later on as it goes along.\u00a0 I think people are going to be surprised at how many people, not only soldiers, have been killed in Ukraine.\u00a0 A lot more people than you think.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, as part of a peace deal with Putin, would you be willing to consider removing all American troops from Europe?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, nobody has asked me to do that, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have to do that.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0 But that question has never really come up.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you support stationing European peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of this peace deal?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 If they want to do that, that\u2019s great.\u00a0 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m all for it.\u00a0 If they want to do that, I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019d be fine.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if the Russians are opposed \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I mean, I know France has mentioned it, others have mentioned it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if the Russians are \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 UK has mentioned it.\u00a0 But yeah, if \u2014 well, if we have a peace deal, I think having troops over there for \u2014 from the standpoint of Europe \u2014 we won\u2019t have to put any over there, because, you know, we\u2019re very far away, but having troops over there would be fine.\u00a0 I would not object to it at all.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re talking about this now: peace.\u00a0 We have either a ceasefire or a peace itself, and we\u2019re looking to do both.\u00a0 Would start off with the ceasefire.\u00a0 And if they want to do that \u2014 I know France was willing to do that, and I thought that was a beautiful gesture.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after three years of fighting, might feel betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think I\u2019m really disappointed in what\u2019s happened.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been watching this for three years.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war that would have never happened if I was president.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been watching these \u2014 these, you know, people being killed at levels that you\u2019ve rarely seen \u2014 not \u2014 not even close since the Second World War, and I\u2019m very disappointed.\u00a0 I hear that, you know, they\u2019re upset about not having a seat.\u00a0 Well, they\u2019ve had a seat for three years and a long time before that.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This could have been settled very easily.\u00a0 Just a half \u2014 a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without \u2014 I think, without the loss of much land, very little land; without the loss of any lives; and without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have those magnificent golden domes that are shattered, will never be replaced.\u00a0 You can\u2019t replace them.\u00a0 Thousand-year-old domes that are so beautiful.\u00a0 You can\u2019t replace that.\u00a0 A whole civilization has changed because of what \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, when they\u2019re worried about not being seated, you mean somebody that should have gone in and made a deal a long time ago.\u00a0 You could have made a deal.\u00a0 This is one that could have made a deal.\u00a0 There was no talk of this during the Trump administration.\u00a0 Putin would have never, ever done it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, by the way, we wouldn\u2019t have had October 7th.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t have had October 7th either in Israel, and we wouldn\u2019t have that mess that\u2019s going on over there.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s like you \u2014 we have great fire people here.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting out fires.\u00a0 All over the world, we\u2019re putting out fires.\u00a0 So, that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0\n\nAnd you know what else wouldn\u2019t have happened?\u00a0 Inflation, because it was caused, really, by the cost of energy going through the roof because of their bad energy policies, and \u2014 and also their spending \u2014 their terrible spending, wasteful spending on the Green New Scam.\u00a0 It\u2019s a scam.\u00a0 It\u2019s a whole big scam.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 I want to ask you a little closer to home.\u00a0 What would it take for you to reconsider the restrictions on the Associated Press?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And secondly, some of your advisers are concerned with the Associated Press\u2019s style guide, using language and giving guidance to not use words like \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d or to use phrases like \u201cgender-affirming care,\u201d and they\u2019re concerned about that being an encroaching amount of liberalism in the way in which the press writes about things.\u00a0 Do you share those concerns?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I do think that some of the phrases that they want to use are ridiculous, and I think, frankly, they\u2019ve become obsolete, especially in the last three weeks, because many things have happened in the last three weeks.\u00a0\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know about that, but I would say that if they want to use certain phrases like that \u2014 and I guess some are okay, but many aren\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nBut the Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what has taken place.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the Gulf of America now.\u00a0 It\u2019s not called the Gulf of Mexico any longer.\u00a0 I have the right to do it, just like we have the right to do Mount McKinley, and nobody is even challenging that.\u00a0 But only the Associate- \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s primarily the Associated Press, and I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, but I just say that we\u2019re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it\u2019s the Gulf of America.\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud of this country, and we want it to be the Gulf of America.\u00a0\n\nNow, the Associated Press, as you know, has been very, very wrong on the election, on Trump, and the treatment of Trump, and other things having to do with Trump and Republicans and conservatives.\u00a0 And they\u2019re doing us no favors, and I guess I\u2019m not doing them any favors.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way life works.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, thank you for the question.\u00a0 Who are you with?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Axios, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s a very good question.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nYes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 We\u2019re hearing that Russia wants to force Ukraine to hold new elections in order to sign any kind of a peace deal.\u00a0 Is that something that the U.S. would ever support?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we have a situation where we haven\u2019t had elections in Ukraine; where we have martial law \u2014 essentially martial law in Ukraine; where the leader in Ukraine \u2014 I mean, I hate to say it, but he\u2019s down at 4 percent approval rating; and where a country has been blown to smithereens.\u00a0\n\nYou got \u2014 most of the cities are laying on their sides. \u00a0The buildings are collapsed.\u00a0 It looks like a massive demolition site.\u00a0 The whole \u2014 I mean, so many of the cities \u2014 I mean, they haven\u2019t done it in Kyiv, because I guess they don\u2019t want to shoot too many rockets in there.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done it 20 percent, but they haven\u2019t done it 100 percent.\u00a0 If they wanted to do it 100 percent, it would probably happen very quickly.\u00a0 But you have cities that are absolutely decimated.\u00a0\n\nAnd yeah, I would say that, you know, when they want a seat at the table, you could say, the people have to \u2014 wouldn\u2019t the people of Ukraine have to say, like, you know, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had an election\u201d?\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not a Russia thing.\u00a0 That\u2019s something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you be concerned about Russia putting up a puppet \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know, Ukraine is being just \u2014 just wiped out.\u00a0 Look at what\u2019s happening to the cities.\u00a0 That \u2014 there are cities, there\u2019s not even a building standing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a massive \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you talk about Gaza.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 literally, these cities look like Gaza.\u00a0 Actually, many have, percentage-wise, more buildings knocked down than in Gaza.\u00a0\n\nSo, you know, people are tired of it.\u00a0 People want to see something happen.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, the other thing that \u2014 it\u2019s been bothering me for a long time, because I di- \u2014 I solved the problem with NATO.\u00a0 They paid hundreds of billions of dollars into the funds of NATO when I said, \u201cYou got to pay,\u201d because the United States was paying for European countries, and then they take advantage of us on trade.\u00a0\n\nBut I\u2019ve seen it.\u00a0 Look, we have to \u2014 they have to pay.\u00a0 They have to find out, where is the money going to?\u00a0 We have \u2014 I believe President Zelenskyy said last week that he doesn\u2019t know where half of the money is that we gave him.\u00a0 Well, we gave them, I believe, $350 billion, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s something less than that.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a lot.\n\nAnd we have to equalize with Europe, because Europe has given us a \u2014 given a very much smaller percentage than that.\u00a0 I think Europe has given 100 billion, and we\u2019ve given, let\u2019s say, 300-plus, and it\u2019s more important for them than it is for us.\u00a0 We have an ocean in between, and they don\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nBut where is all the money that\u2019s been given?\u00a0 Where is it going?\u00a0 And nobody \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen an accounting of it.\u00a0 We give hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 I have \u2014 I don\u2019t see any \u2014 any accounting.\u00a0\n\nSo, I want to see peace.\u00a0 Look, you know why I want?\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t want all these people killed anymore.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking at people that are being killed, and they\u2019re Russian and Ukrainian people, but they\u2019re people \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter where they\u2019re from on \u2014 on the whole planet.\u00a0 And I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it\u2019s going very well.\u00a0\n\nBut today, I heard, \u201cOh, well, we weren\u2019t invited.\u201d\u00a0 Well, you\u2019ve been there for three years.\u00a0 You should have ended it three years \u2014 you should have never started it.\u00a0 You could have made a deal.\u00a0\n\nI could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land \u2014 everything \u2014 almost all of the land, and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down.\u00a0 But they chose not to do it that way.\u00a0\n\nAnd President Biden, in all fairness, he doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u00a0 What he \u2014 he was so bad for this.\u00a0 He was so bad, so pathetic, and so sad.\n\nBut with all of that being said, look, we \u2014 it is what it is.\u00a0\n\nWhen I left, there was no chance that this could have happened, but it happened because we had incompetent leadership at many different levels.\u00a0\n\nBut when you see what\u2019s taken place in Ukraine, with millions of people killed, including the soldiers \u2014 millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how anybody even lives there.\u00a0\n\nYou know, when they say they took a poll and Zelenskyy is at 4 percent, who\u2019s living there?\u00a0 You know, I mean, people are \u2014 it\u2019s hard to believe that people live there.\u00a0 Their cities are being knocked down.\u00a0\n\nAnd this is something that would have never happened.\u00a0 And, by the way, for four years, it didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 It was never going to happen.\u00a0\n\nGo ahead.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I ask one follow-up question?\u00a0 How would you counter the perception \u2014 because Russia is pushing for this, obviously; they don\u2019t really hold true elections \u2014 that that would be a capitulation of some sort?\u00a0 How would you guard against, potentially, Russia installing a puppet government?\u00a0\n\nAnd then, finally, how would that new election have an impact on getting Zelenskyy to sign the rare earth minerals deal?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Look, you have leadership \u2014 and \u2014 and I like him personally.\u00a0 He\u2019s fine.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t care about personally.\u00a0 I care about getting the job done.\u00a0\n\nYou have leadership now that\u2019s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened, even without the United States.\u00a0 Look, we had a president who was grossly incompetent.\u00a0 He had no idea what he was doing.\u00a0 He said some very stupid things, like going in for portions and all of the things.\u00a0 He made a lot of bad statements.\u00a0 But he\u2019s grossly incompetent, and I think everyone knew that.\n\nThis is something that should have never happened \u2014 would have never happened.\u00a0 And I used to discuss it with Putin.\u00a0 President Putin and I would talk about Ukraine.\u00a0 It was the apple of his eye, I will tell you that.\u00a0 But he never \u2014 there was never a chance of him going in.\u00a0\n\nAnd I told him, \u201cYou better not go in.\u00a0 Don\u2019t go in.\u00a0 Don\u2019t go in.\u201d\u00a0 And he understood that, and he understood it fully.\u00a0 But I\u2019m only interested \u2014 I want to see if I can save maybe millions of lives.\u00a0 This could even end up in a World War III, I mean, to be honest with you.\n\nYou\u2019ve been hearing \u2014 now Europe is saying, \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re going to go in and we\u2019re going to go\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 All of a sudden, you\u2019re going to end up in World War III over something that should have never happened.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a very sad situation.\u00a0\n\nYeah, please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, in a court filing, the White House said that Elon Musk is not a DOGE employee and has no authority to make decisions.\u00a0 Can you clarify for us today \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, Elon Musk \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 what his exact role is there?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, yeah.\u00a0 Elon is, to me, a patriot.\u00a0 So, you know, you could call him an employee.\u00a0 You could call him a consultant.\u00a0 You could call him whatever you want.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a patriot.\u00a0\n\nI mean, look at the kind of things \u2014 I just said, \u201cJust write it down, just in case that question got asked.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 And which \u2014 I\u2019m surprised it took so long, actually.\u00a0\n\nBut you know what?\u00a0 Ukraine is a bigger deal, because people are dying by the thousands a week \u2014 thousands.\u00a0 But look at this.\u00a0 From 90 to 99, Social Security: 6,054,000 people.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s possible.\u00a0 You know, 90 to ninety- \u2014 99.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s possible.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of people, though, with that.\n\nBut people that live to 100 to 109: 4,734,000.\u00a0 Wow, that\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 That means over 100 years old.\u00a0 There are 4 million people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know too many.\u00a0 I know people that are doing great in their 90s, but not too many people over 100.\u00a0 But over 120 \u2014 from 120 years old \u2014 people that are 120 years old, up to 129: 3,472,000 people.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0\n\nYou know that can\u2019t possibly be because the record is like \u2014 I think it\u2019s one person \u2014 a woman lived to 127.\u00a0 But they have 3,472-.\u00a0 Okay.\n\nBut now we\u2019re going really in.\u00a0 People from 130 years old to 139 years old: 3,936,000.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 I wonder if people are getting paid with all this.\u00a0 I mean, are these checks \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re checking right now.\u00a0\n\nPeople from 140 years old to 149 years old: 3,542,000.\u00a0 A hundred and forty years old and beyond.\u00a0 Now \u2014 now we\u2019re really going because we\u2019re looking to break the record by 25 years.\u00a0\n\nPeople from 150 years old to 159 years old: 1,345,000.\u00a0 These are in the \u2014 by the way, these are in the computer files.\u00a0\n\nThese are \u2014 this is what they do well.\u00a0 They\u2019re super \u2014 I asked Elon, \u201cWho are these DOGE people?\u201d\u00a0 He said they\u2019re super brilliant computer people and they love the country.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s simple.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does he \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wait a minute.\u00a0 People from 160 years old to 169 years: 121,000.\u00a0 So, 160-year-old people.\n\nA hundred and seventy to a hundred and seventy-nine ~~thousand~~: six thousand oh-eighty-seven.\n\nBut now let\u2019s go into the real numbers.\u00a0 From 200 to 209 years old: 879 people.\n\nFrom 210 years old \u2014 I haven\u2019t met any of them.\u00a0 And if I did, I\u2019d \u2014 I would bless them.\u00a0 I would \u2014 I would worship the ground they walk on.\u00a0 Two hundred and ten to two hundred and nineteen years: eight hundred and sixty-six.\n\nFrom 220 years old to 229 years old: 1,039.\n\nAnd then, you have two people \u2014 from 240 years old to 249 years old: one person.\u00a0 And there\u2019s one person that\u2019s 360 years old.\n\nThat\u2019s just that.\u00a0 And then, where\u2019s the money being spent?\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Let\u2019s go into that for just a second.\n\nFive hundred and twenty million dollars for a consultant on the environment.\u00a0 It\u2019s called Environmental, Social, and Governance, investments in Africa and mobilize private-sector resources: $520 million.\u00a0 Somebody got $520 million for an environmental \u2014 sounds like an environmental study.\u00a0 That\u2019s the most \u2014\n\nI\u2019ve always been one that paid a lot of money for my environmental studies, but they \u2014 you know, I paid like $50,000 not $520 million.\u00a0 Five hundred and twenty million dollars for ESG.\n\nTwenty-five million dollars to promote biodiversity, conservation, and promote licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in the country of Colombia.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s nice.\u00a0 Twenty-five million going to Colombia for something that nobody ever heard of.\u00a0\n\nForty million dollars to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.\u00a0 Forty million.\n\nForty-two million dollars for Johns Hopkins \u2014 great place \u2014 to research and drive social and behavior change in Uganda.\u00a0 Forty-two million.\u00a0 What about us?\u00a0 What about social change in our country?\n\nSeventy million dollars for a center at Purdue to research university-sourced, evidence-based solutions to developmental challenges.\u00a0 I mean, these are massive numbers on things that nobody ever heard about.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ten million dollars for Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcisions.\u00a0 Ten million dollars for circumcisions in another country.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $9.7 million for UC Berkeley to develop a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise-driven skills.\u00a0 In other words, let\u2019s teach them something about enterprise.\u00a0 What about our people?\u00a0 Can\u2019t we teach them about enterprise?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.3 million for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.\u00a0\n\nThirty-two million dollars to the Prague Civil Society Centre, which is a very liberal group of people.\u00a0 I wonder how much of that money came back to the people that approved it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fourteen million dollars for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four hundred eighty-six million dollars to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including twenty-two million dollars for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova.\n\nAnd $21 million for voter turnout in India.\u00a0 Well, why are we giving $21 million to India?\u00a0 They got a lot of money.\u00a0 They\u2019re the h- \u2014 one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us.\u00a0 We can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high.\u00a0 I have a lot of respect for India.\u00a0 I have a lot of respect for the prime minister.\u00a0 He just left, as you know, two days ago.\u00a0 But we\u2019re giving $21 million for voter turnout.\u00a0 It\u2019s voter turnout in India. \u00a0What about, like, voter turnout here?\u00a0 Oh, we\u2019ve done that, I guess.\u00a0 We did $500 million, didn\u2019t we?\u00a0 It\u2019s called the lockboxes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But closer to home \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Twenty million dollars for fiscal federalism in Nepal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Listen to these numbers.\u00a0 These are \u2014 this is all fraud.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nineteen million dollars for biodiversity conservation in Nepal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $1.5 million for voter confidence \u2014 we want to give them confidence \u2014 in Liberia.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fourteen million dollars for social cohesion in Mali.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Forty-seven million dollars for improving learning outcomes in Asia.\u00a0 Asia is doing very well.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing a lot better than we do in the schools, aren\u2019t they?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two million dollars to develop sustainable recycling models to increase socioeconomic cohesion among marginalized communities in Kosovo and Ashkali and in Egypt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 I could \u2014 I could \u2014 by the way, I could read this all day long.\u00a0 I could go on all day long, and you\u2019ll see hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But when I saw the Social Security numbers, I said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really something.\u201d\u00a0 So, we have \u2014 let\u2019s just go above 100 years old.\u00a0 We have millions and millions of people over 100 years old.\u00a0 Everybody knows that\u2019s not so.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have a very corrupt country \u2014 a very corrupt country.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a sad thing to say, but we\u2019re figuring it out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, the good thing about Social Security and what I read is if you take all of those numbers off, because they\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent \u2014 but if you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden, we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old.\u00a0 You know, so it\u2019s a very positive thing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How about over here?\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your reaction to Michelle King, the head, resigning after the DOGE investigation?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who resigned?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The head of Social Security.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I mean, I \u2014 resigned or got fired?\u00a0 I think got fired.\u00a0 You know, when you fire somebody, they always resign, and then they say, \u201cWe resigned.\u201d\u00a0 But when you have numbers like that, I think, really, it\u2019s \u201cGot fired.\u201d\u00a0 They have to get fired.\u00a0 Who would \u2014 who would keep them?\u00a0 How could you have numbers like this?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, the big thing is, how many of these people got paid?\u00a0 Were they getting paid?\u00a0 Were they getting paid?\u00a0 How many of them were getting paid Social Security?\u00a0 Because that\u2019s \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a massive fraud.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to call those great Palm Beach police into this situation, right?\u00a0 You guys would figure that out very quickly.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But how many of them are being paid?\u00a0 I mean, maybe millions of them, but it\u2019s a total fraud.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, a lot of illegal immigrants are on Social Security that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, there was a big wave of probationary federal workers who were fired over the weekend.\u00a0 Some of these workers focused on nuclear weapons security were immediately rehired.\u00a0 Do you have any concerns about how these terminations have played out?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, not at all.\u00a0 I think we have to just do what we have to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 you know, you\u2019re going to\n\n\u2014 it\u2019s amazing what\u2019s been found right now.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, some \u2014 if we feel that \u2014 in some cases, they\u2019ll fire people and then they\u2019ll put some people back \u2014 not all of them, because a lot of people were let go.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget, I got elected on the basis of making our government stronger and smaller, because we have millions of people that \u2014 obviously, they\u2019re paying millions of people that shouldn\u2019t be paid.\u00a0 And that has also to do with workers.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0 No, go ahead.\u00a0 Axios, New York Times.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sorry.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, given your concerns about corruption, you said that if there were any conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, you wouldn\u2019t \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 let him anywhere near it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DOGE and SpaceX employees are now working directly at the Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department \u2014 agencies that have billions of dollars in contracts with Musk\u2019s companies, or that directly regulate \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 his companies.\u00a0 How is that not a conflict of interest?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I mean, I\u2019m just hearing about it, and if there is \u2014 and he told me before I told him, but obviously, I will not let there be any conflict of interest.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s done an amazing job.\u00a0 They\u2019ve revealed \u2014 in fact, he\u2019s going to be on tonight a big show called \u201cSean Hannity\u201d at 9 o\u2019clock, and he\u2019s on and I\u2019m on, and we talk about a lot of different things.\u00a0\n\nAnd any conflicts \u2014 I told Elon, any conflicts, you can\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u00a0 So, anything to do with possibly even space, we won\u2019t let Elon partake in that.\u00a0\n\nYeah.\u00a0 Please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On immigration, sir.\u00a0 You said you would be sending the worst of the worst to Guantanamo Bay.\u00a0 What we\u2019re finding out is that there are a lot of low-risk migrants who don\u2019t have a criminal background who are also being sent.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you thinking about this differently now about who is being sent?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, they\u2019re going to be brought back to their countries.\u00a0 And with some persuasion, every one of those countries \u2014 every one in the \u2014 as you know, every country is taking the people back.\u00a0 So, some of them are going to be brought back to \u2014 many of them \u2014 any of them that are low-risk, as you say, are going to be brought back to their countries.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But why hold them in Guantanamo?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, go ahead, please.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you give us a bit of an update on where you stand with Venezuela?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Sure.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Its oil \u2014 there are \u2014 there is, basically, a monthly license that can soon ex- \u2014 extend to a six-month license.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you know, we had Venezuela on the run, and it looked like that was going to be very good.\u00a0 And when Biden came in, as he always does, he screws it up.\u00a0 And they started buying millions and millions and millions of dollars of oil \u2014 billions of dollars, actually, of oil.\u00a0 And it gave them a new lic- \u2014 a new, really, lease on life.\n\nAnd \u2014 but we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We had some pretty good discussions with a lot of people within our government \u2014 in the United States government that are involved in that.\u00a0 And Venezuela is a little bit early.\u00a0 But, you know, we were not buying from Venezuela.\u00a0\n\nWhen Biden came in, for whatever reason, instead of just taking the beautiful, as I call it, liquid gold \u2014 we have more than anybody \u2014 they started paying a fortune to Venezuela.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at that actually.\u00a0 Why did they do that?\u00a0 Why were they doing that?\u00a0 Why would they go to the enemy and give them billions and billions of dollars?\n\nNow, with that being said, as you know, Venezuela has said very strongly, they will not take any \u2014 any illegal immigrant, any of the people that they sent over to us.\u00a0 They sent their gangs, probably the worst gang anywhere in the world \u2014 as bad as MS-13, maybe worse \u2014 and they came out of the jails of Venezuela.\u00a0 They emptied their jails into our country, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never take them back.\u201d\u00a0 Well, they took them back, and they\u2019re taking them back, and they are taking them back rapidly.\u00a0 They were sending a lot of people to Venezuela.\u00a0 They said they wouldn\u2019t take them back, and they are taking back.\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019re looking at Venezuela very seriously, and we\u2019re going to be able \u2014 don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve only been here for three weeks.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I could just a follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just a little clarity on: Are you inclined to continue to allow Venezuela, through, I think, Chevron and other oil companies, to export those petroleum products, or are you \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Maybe not.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 inclined to pullback on that?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, maybe not.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at that now.\u00a0 I just got here.\u00a0 When I was \u2014 when I left, they weren\u2019t doing anything.\u00a0 They were ready to go, \u201cWe give up.\u201d\u00a0 And then Biden came along, and he gave them \u2014 literally billions of dollars.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe it, actually.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have so much under our feet \u2014 liquid gold.\u00a0 We have so much.\u00a0 And it was pretty amazing.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re looking at the whole situation, why he did it.\u00a0\n\nAll right, how about one more?\u00a0 Yeah, please.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 What can you tell us about the CIA drone flights over Mexico?\u00a0 Is this the next step in the war against the cartels?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to see.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should they have authority \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to take lethal action?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Mexico has allowed a tremendous number of people to go through their country into ours, and even people coming from Mexico, and illegals \u2014 totally illegal.\u00a0 They\u2019ve allowed people to empty jails into Mexico and then let them come through with this totally ridiculous open-border policy of the Biden administration.\u00a0\n\nSo, millions of people have come in, and hundreds of thousands and, actually, millions are criminals.\u00a0 They came in from jails all over the world that release them into Mexico, and they come into our country.\u00a0\n\nAnd they also came in from Canada, by the way \u2014 large numbers through Canada.\u00a0 In fact, when \u2014 when we closed up the one border, they came in through the other border.\u00a0 So, Canada was \u2014 is not a \u2014 an uninterested party.\n\nBut I will say this.\u00a0 We\u2019re dealing with Mexico.\u00a0 I have a very good relationship with Mexico.\u00a0 But I think Mexico is largely run by the cartels, and that\u2019s a sad thing to say.\u00a0 And if they wanted help with that, we\u2019d give them help.\u00a0\n\nBut Mexico \u2014 if you look at what\u2019s gone on with Mexico for years now, but now, especially, it\u2019s run by the cartels.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve allowed millions of people to come into our country from jails and prisons of other countries, from all over the world \u2014 not just South America \u2014 Africa, Asia, all over \u2014 a lot from the Congo in Africa \u2014 a lot.\u00a0 They opened their jails.\u00a0 They came in through Mexico, and we have some of the worst criminals coming in from the Congo and other places.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s not just South America and it\u2019s not just Venezuela.\u00a0 But they opened their jails.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, the crime rates in Venezuela and other places all over the world has gone way down.\u00a0 You know why? Because they\u2019ve given us their prisoners.\u00a0 They\u2019ve \u2014 given us their drug lords and their gang members.\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to believe that we accepted this.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe that we allowed open borders, and we\u2019re taking in, you know, hundreds of thousands and millions of people coming in from all over the world that are absolute stone-cold criminals.\u00a0 In fact, 11,088 murderers, and many of those people have co- \u2014 have murdered more than one person.\u00a0\n\nWhy are they giving us these people?\u00a0 And why are we taking these people?\u00a0\n\nUnder Biden, you know, you had a border czar that never went to the border \u2014 happened to be a vice president \u2014 never went to the border, never called the border people.\u00a0\n\nI call them all the time.\u00a0 I speak to them all the time.\u00a0\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news, we have the most secure border we\u2019ve ever had right now \u2014 as secure and even more secure than I had it four years ago.\u00a0 And the Border Patrol is doing incredible. \u00a0ICE is doing incredible.\u00a0 Tom Homan is unbelievable.\u00a0 And Kristi Noem has been just working very, very hard \u2014 very, very hard.\n\nAnd we have the best numbers we\u2019ve ever had, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to find out how a thing like this could have happened to our country, because who would allow this to happen?\u00a0 What they\u2019ve done to our country is so sad.\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you still be meeting with President Putin before the end of the month?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, probably.\u00a0 Probably.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4:49 P.M.
