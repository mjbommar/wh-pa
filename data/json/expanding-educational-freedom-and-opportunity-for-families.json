or(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n",
  "summary": "On January 29, 2025, a presidential order was issued to expand educational freedom and opportunities for families in the United States. Concerned with the inadequate performance of many government-run K-12 schools in addressing essential reading and math skills, the new policy aims to empower parents with greater control over their children\u2019s education. Through initiatives like state-driven K-12 scholarship programs and educational choice, the government seeks to enhance the educational landscape by promoting competition and choice.\n\nThe order sets out several actionable steps for different federal departments. The Secretary of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Defense, and Interior are instructed to review and potentially allocate federal funds towards supporting educational choice. These funds could be used for alternatives like private and faith-based schools, particularly to benefit low-income families, military families, and children eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools. All actions must comply with existing laws and are subject to budgetary considerations.\n\nThis initiative underscores the administration's commitment to educational reform by involving federal support in state-led educational alternatives. It emphasizes better performance, equity in educational access, and improved national competitiveness through diverse educational options.",
