Trump Launches Massive 10-to-1 Deregulation Initiative**********\n\nJanuary 31, 2025\n\n**ELIMINATING 10 REGULATIONS FOR EACH NEW REGULATION ISSUED**: Today, President Donald J.

  "summary": "### Summary\n\nOn January 31, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at significantly reducing federal regulations in the United States. The order mandates that federal agencies must rescind ten existing regulations for every new regulation they introduce. The goal is to not only reduce the quantity of regulatory restrictions but also their associated costs, ensuring that the net incremental cost of regulations for the fiscal year 2025 is significantly negative. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for implementing standardized measures to estimate regulatory costs, thereby facilitating the execution of this policy.\n\nTrump's administration criticizes the preceding Biden Administration for imposing over $1.7 trillion in regulatory costs, which they claim stifles economic growth by hindering entrepreneurship, limiting consumer choices, and increasing living costs, particularly energy prices. This new Executive Order expands upon Trump's previous deregulation efforts during his first administration, where he successfully achieved a deregulation ratio of 5.5 eliminations for every new regulation made, surpassing his initial goal of 2-to-1.",
