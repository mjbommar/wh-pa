EST\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, Daytona was fantastic.\u00a0 The crowd was amazing.\u00a0 The people love that sport, and they\u2019re wonderful people that run it.\u00a0 And they had a little rain delay, but we\u2019ll go home and watch it, I guess \u2014 or some of you will.\u00a0 And others will try and create peace throughout the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any questions, please?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, did you speak to Secretary Rubio this morning?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I did.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the latest with the negotiations in Saudi Arabia?\u00a0 What\u2019s he taki- \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re moving along.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to get a peace with Russia-Ukraine, and we\u2019re working very hard on it.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war that should have never started.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you expect Zelenskyy to be involved in these conversations?\u00a0 What will his role be?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I do.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 He will be involved, yes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, would you allow the Europeans to buy U.S.-made weapons for Ukrainians?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I would.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, Zelenskyy said today that Russia is going to wage war on NATO.\u00a0 Do you \u2014 do you agree with that?\u00a0 Do you have any concerns about \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t agree.\u00a0 I don\u2019t agree with that.\u00a0 Not even a little bit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vice President Vance said that the United States would potentially take military action against Russia if they won\u2019t come to an agreement.\u00a0 Do you agree with that stance?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what he said.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think he said that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, based on your conversations \u2014 based on your conversations with President Putin, what do you think he wants, ultimately, in Ukraine?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think he wants to stop fighting.\u00a0 I see that.\u00a0 We spoke long and hard.\u00a0 Steve Witkoff was with him for a very extended period, like about three hours.\u00a0 I think he wants to stop fighting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They have a big, powerful machine.\u00a0 You understand that.\u00a0 And they defeated Hitler, and they defeated Napoleon.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019ve been fighting a long time.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done it before and \u2014 but I think he would like to stop fighting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think he wants the whole of Ukraine, or just a pa- \u2014 like, what do you think he wants in terms territory?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I think he wants to stop.\u00a0 That was my question to him.\u00a0 Because if he\u2019s going to go on, that would have been a big problem for us, and that would have caused me a big problem, because you just can\u2019t let that happen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast \u2014 both of them.\u00a0 And Zelenskyy wants to end it too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, when do you think that could actually happen?\u00a0 When do you think the fighting can stop?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re working to get it done.\u00a0 I mean, you know, it\u2019s too bad it started.\u00a0 It would have been a lot easier to end it before it started.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 But it started because we had an incompetent president that \u2014 he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u00a0 That should have never started.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That war was so easy to stop.\u00a0 Remember this: that under Bush, they took a lot.\u00a0 Under Obama, they took a lot.\u00a0 Under Biden, they\u2019re trying to take the whole thing.\u00a0 And under Trump, they took nothing \u2014 nothing.\u00a0 Nothing was gone, not even a little bit.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s too bad.\u00a0 It\u2019s really too bad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of people are dead right now that should be alive, and a lot of cities are destroyed that can never come back like they were.\u00a0 Those beautiful golden domes and all of the multi-colored domes that were 1,000 years old, they\u2019re all laying in \u2014 you know, just shattered.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s very sad.\u00a0 They ruined a culture.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019re beginning phase two \u2014 they\u2019re beginning phase two of the ceasefire deal \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 between Israel and Hama- \u2014 Hamas.\u00a0 What is \u2014 what\u2019s going on there?\u00a0 Have you been briefed on the latest relating to that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I told you \u2014 I have been briefed.\u00a0 I told Bibi, \u201cYou do whatever you want.\u201d\u00a0 Because, you know, my statement was, \u201cThey got to come back now.\u201d\u00a0 The reason I made that statement: because they said they weren\u2019t going to deliver \u2014 they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver.\u00a0 And they did agree to do that, but they broke that agreement.\u00a0 When I made the statement, they delivered everybody, plus an American.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, the good news is, they look like they\u2019re in pretty good shape, because the people from the week before didn\u2019t look like they were in good shape.\u00a0 They looked like Holocaust survivors, frankly \u2014 horrible.\u00a0 Whatever happened to them was horrible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But that will be up to Israel what the next step is, in consultation with me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, what would the \u2014 what are they supposed to use these weapons for that you\u2019ve now allowed to be shipped?\u00a0 Given the fact that there\u2019s a ceasefire supposed to be in effect, why ship those big bombs now?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Peace through strength.\u00a0 You understand that, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s called peace through strength.\u00a0 You know, they contracted for those weapons a long time ago, in the Biden administration, and then Biden wouldn\u2019t deliver the weapons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I look at it differently.\u00a0 I say \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d\u00a0 They were sitting there.\u00a0 Nobody knew what to do with them.\u00a0 They bought them.\u00a0 But I believe in that very strongly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the EU \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you have an update on your \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, on the EU.\u00a0 The \u2014 the European Union is talking about banning food imports from the U.S., kind of along the lines of your reciprocal tariffs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Why?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They says it\u2019s like the reciprocal tariffs.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like the (inaudible) \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s all right.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mind.\u00a0 Let them do it.\u00a0 Let them do it.\u00a0 They\u2019re just hurting themselves if they do that.\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine it, but doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re having reciprocal tariffs.\u00a0 Whatever they charge, we charge.\u00a0 Very simple.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a certain country, like India, which is very high tariff \u2014 if they charge us X dollars, we charge them X dollars.\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fair \u2014 it\u2019s a fair thing to do.\u00a0 Even the media said it was fair.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to be very good for the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have an update on your timing of your meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, we \u2014 there\u2019s no time set, but it could be very soon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like this \u2014 this month or \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019ll be soon.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 But they\u2019re meeting right now, and that\u2019s more \u2014 I mean, this should have been done four years ago \u2014 three years ago, before it started.\u00a0 But it should have been done immediately after it started, as opposed to now, three years later.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, egg prices have reached an all-time high.\u00a0 What\u2019s your administra- \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Which is?\u00a0 What?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Egg prices have reached an all-time high.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s the flu.\u00a0 And it was a long \u2014 before I ever got here, it was at an all-time \u2014 this didn\u2019t st- \u2014 remember, I\u2019ve been here for three weeks.\u00a0 And when you saw the inflation numbers, I\u2019ve been here for three weeks.\u00a0 I have had nothing to do with inflation.\u00a0 This was caused by Biden.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had four years of virtually no inflation.\u00a0 So, I\u2019m just taking over.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I\u2019ll tell you what, this country has made more progress in the last three weeks than it\u2019s made in the last four years, and we\u2019re respected again as a country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
