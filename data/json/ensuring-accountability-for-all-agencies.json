vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\u202f\u00a0\n\nSection1. \u00a0Policy and Purpose. \u00a0The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. \u00a0Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. \u00a0In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President\u2019s\u00a0ongoing supervision and control. \u00a0The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. \u00a0This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, previous administrations have allowed so-called \u201cindependent regulatory agencies\u201d to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. \u00a0These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. \u00a0Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0These practices undermine such regulatory agencies\u2019 accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. \u00a0For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people\u2019s\u00a0elected President.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials\u2019 accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of\u00a0the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. \u00a0Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and\u00a0final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the\u00a0*Federal Register*.\u00a0\n\nSec.\u00a02. \u00a0Definitions. \u00a0For the purposes of this order:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a) \u00a0The term \u201cemployees\u201d shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0The term \u201cindependent regulatory agency\u201d shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code. \u00a0This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. \u00a0This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0The term \u201cindependent regulatory agency chairman\u201d shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency\u2019s\u00a0chairman, director, or other presiding officer.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d) \u00a0The term \u201chead\u201d of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies\u2019 authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sec.\u00a03. \u00a0OIRA Review of Agency Regulations. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (\u201cRegulatory

Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. \u00a0This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.\u201d.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866. \u00a0Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such

objectives.\u00a0\n\nSec.\u00a05. \u00a0Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies. \u00a0The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis:\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)

independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies\u2019 apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President\u2019s\u00a0policies and priorities. \u00a0Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law.\u00a0\n\nSec.\u00a06. \u00a0Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the

agencies. \u00a0Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service.\u202f\u202f\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993\u00a0to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to

  "summary": "This order issued on February 18, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to increase accountability across all federal agencies and ensure their alignment with the President's intentions. The order targets independent regulatory agencies, which have previously operated with considerable autonomy, often exercising significant executive power without oversight from the President. To address this, the order mandates that all significant regulatory actions be reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office before publication.\n\nThe directive also involves modifying existing rules from a 1993 Executive Order, requiring independent regulatory agency submissions to be reviewed by the OIRA. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is tasked with establishing performance standards for agency heads and ensuring agency activities reflect presidential policies. Consultation between agencies and various offices in the Executive Office of the President is required, ensuring coordination of policy direction and strategic plans. Furthermore, the order emphasizes that the President's and Attorney General\u2019s legal interpretations are binding for all federal employees, reflecting the order's broader intent to centralize executive accountability.",
