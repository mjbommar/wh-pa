the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n**Section 1. \u00a0Purpose.** \u00a0The United States must grow its economy and maintain jobs for its citizens while playing a leadership role in global efforts to protect the environment. \u00a0Over decades, with the help of sensible policies that do not encumber private-sector activity, the United States has simultaneously grown its economy, raised worker wages, increased energy production, reduced air and water pollution, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a0The United States\u2019 successful track record of advancing both economic and environmental objectives should be a model for other countries.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has purported to join international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country\u2019s values or our contributions to the pursuit of economic and environmental objectives.\u00a0 Moreover, these agreements steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\n\n**Sec. 2. \u00a0Policy.**It is the policy of my Administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy. \u00a0These agreements must not unduly or unfairly burden the United States.\n\n**Sec. 3. \u00a0Implementation.**\u00a0(a) \u00a0The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit formal written notification of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\u00a0 The notice shall be submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Depositary of the Agreement, attached as Appendix A. \u00a0The United States will consider its withdrawal from the Agreement and any attendant obligations to be effective immediately upon this provision of notification.\u00a0\n\n(b) \u00a0The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall immediately submit written formal notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, or any relevant party, of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from any agreement, pact, accord, or similar commitment made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\n(c) \u00a0The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury, shall immediately cease or revoke any purported financial commitment made by the United States under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\n(d) \u00a0Immediately upon completion of the tasks listed in subsections (a), (b), and (c), the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury shall certify a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that describes in detail any further action required to achieve the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order.\n\n(e) \u00a0The U.S. International Climate Finance Plan is revoked and rescinded immediately. \u00a0The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, within 10 days of this order, issue guidance for the rescission of all frozen funds.\n\n(f) \u00a0Within 30 days of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Chief Executive Officer of the International Development Finance Corporation, Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, President of the Export-Import Bank, and head of any other relevant department or agency shall submit a\u00a0report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs that details their actions to revoke or rescind policies that were implemented to advance the International Climate Finance Plan.\n\n(g) \u00a0The Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, and the head of any department or agency that plans or coordinates international energy agreements shall henceforth prioritize economic efficiency, the promotion of American prosperity, consumer choice, and fiscal restraint in all foreign engagements that concern energy policy.\n\n**Sec. 4. \u00a0General Provisions***.* \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or any other persons.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, January 20, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "This document is an executive order issued on January 20, 2025, by the President of the United States. It outlines the United States' intention to withdraw from international environmental agreements that are considered not to reflect the country's values or interests. The focus is on ensuring that any international commitments do not unfairly burden the U.S. economy or direct taxpayer money to countries that do not warrant such financial support.\n\nSpecifically, the order mandates the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to announce the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and any similar commitments. The order also rescinds financial commitments under these agreements and calls for a report on actions taken to revoke policies that were developed to support the International Climate Finance Plan. It further directs multiple government departments and agencies to prioritize economic efficiency and American interests in international energy engagements.\n\nThe order includes a number of procedural stipulations, ensuring that its implementation does not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary proceedings, and clarifying that it does not create enforceable legal rights for any party.",
