and\n\n(b) \u00a0Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate action to promptly revoke all memoranda, guidance, or other policies based on the Executive Orders revoked in section 3(a) of this order and shall employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all inadmissible and removable aliens.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Civil Enforcement Priorities. \u00a0The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to enable the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to set priorities for their agencies that protect the public safety and national security interests of the American people, including by ensuring the successful enforcement of final orders of removal.\u00a0 Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that the primary mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations division is the enforcement of the provisions of the INA and other Federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States and the enforcement of the purposes of this order.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Criminal Enforcement Priorities. \u00a0The Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all appropriate action to prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States.\n\nSec. 6. \u00a0Federal Homeland Security Task Forces. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to jointly establish Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTFs) in all States nationwide.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The composition of each HSTF shall be subject to the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, but shall include representation from any other Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, or agencies with the ability to provide logistics, intelligence, and operational support to the HSTFs, and shall also include representation from relevant State and local law enforcement agencies.\u00a0 The heads of all Federal agencies shall take all appropriate action to provide support to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the HSTFs fulfill the objectives in subsection (c) of this section, and any other lawful purpose that fulfills the policy objectives of this order.\n\n(c)\u00a0 The objective of each HSTF is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations throughout the United States, dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children, and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.\n\n(d)\u00a0 The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to provide an operational command center to coordinate the activities of the HSTFs and provide such support as they may require, and shall also take all appropriate action to provide supervisory direction to their activities as may be required.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens. \u00a0The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action to:\n\n(a) \u00a0Immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;\n\n(b)\u00a0 Ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with the requirements of part VII of subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 8, United States Code;

and\n\n(b) \u00a0Eliminate all documentary barriers, dilatory tactics, or other restrictions that prevent the prompt repatriation of aliens to any foreign state.\u00a0 Any failure or delay by a foreign state to verify the identity of a national of that state shall be considered in carrying out subsection (a) this section, and shall also be considered regarding the issuance of any other sanctions that may be available to the United States.\n\nSec. 14.\u00a0 Visa Bonds. \u00a0The Secretary of Treasury shall take all appropriate action, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish a system to facilitate the administration of all bonds that the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may lawfully require to administer the provisions of the INA.\n\nSec. 15. \u00a0Reestablishment of the VOICE Office and Addressing Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. \u00a0The Secretary of Homeland Security shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take all appropriate and lawful action to reestablish within ICE an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens, and those victims\u2019 family members. \u00a0The Attorney General shall also ensure that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 are followed in all Federal prosecutions involving crimes committed by removable aliens.\n\nSec. 16. \u00a0Addressing Actions by the Previous Administration. \u00a0The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take all appropriate action, consistent with law, to rescind the policy decisions of the previous administration that led to the increased or continued presence of illegal aliens in the United States, and align any and all departmental activities with the policies set out by this order and the immigration laws. \u00a0Such action should include, but is not limited to:\n\n(a) \u00a0ensuring that the parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised on only a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual alien demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from their particular continued presence in the United States arising from such parole;\n\n(b) \u00a0ensuring that designations of Temporary Protected Status are consistent with the provisions of section 244 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1254a), and that such designations are appropriately limited in scope and made for only so long as may be necessary to fulfill the textual requirements of that statute;

  "summary": "On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued focusing on bolstering enforcement against illegal immigration in the United States. The order outlines multiple actions to enforce federal immigration laws, prioritizing the removal of inadmissible aliens, especially those posing security threats. It rescinds previous executive orders from 2021 seen as easing immigration policies, emphasizing a renewed strict approach.\n\nThe order directs several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, to adopt measures such as establishing Homeland Security Task Forces nationwide, enforcing civil and criminal penalties against immigration violations, and facilitating the swift removal of illegal aliens. Additional measures include increasing detention capacities, enhancing cooperation with state and local law enforcement through agreements like the 287(g), and imposing penalties on jurisdictions not cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nMoreover, the order addresses funding to NGOs assisting undocumented immigrants, calls for a review of public benefits access for illegal aliens, and mandates the reestablishment of an office to support victims of crimes by removable aliens. This comprehensive approach aims to realign immigration-related activities of federal agencies with stricter legal interpretations and enforcement policies.",
