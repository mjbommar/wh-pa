  "summary": "The document contains a list of presidential actions initiated on January 20, 2025, which are accessible through the White House website. The actions are issued under President Donald Trump and include several directives such as restoring freedom of speech and rescinding previous executive orders that are deemed harmful. Additional actions pertain to administrative appointments, where President Trump designates chairmen, acting chairmen, and announces cabinet, sub-cabinet, and cabinet-level appointments.\n\nThese actions reflect the new administration's priorities and organizational changes on Inauguration Day. Key objectives include ending federal censorship, symbolic actions like flying the US flag at full-staff, and setting up the new administration's leadership structure. The page serves as a hub for accessing detailed information about each action.\n\nThe actions are part of a structured list with links to additional resources, each action emphasizing themes of governance, organizational restructuring, and policy shifts following the inauguration of the new presidential term.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to change some rules and organize his big team to make sure people can talk freely and do his job better. It's like when you decide which toys go where and make rules for everyone to play nicely.",
