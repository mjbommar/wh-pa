This interpretation is consistent with section 7\u2019s heading (\u201cTerminating the Green New Deal\u201d) and its reference to the \u201claw and the policy outlined in section 2 of th[e] order.\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of implementing section 7 of the Order, funds supporting the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d refer to any appropriations for objectives that contravene the policies established in section 2. \u00a0Agency heads may disburse funds as they deem necessary after consulting with the Office of Management and Budget.\n",
  "summary": "On January 21, 2025, a memorandum was issued to the heads of departments and agencies, authored by Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Kevin Hassett, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. The purpose of the memorandum is to provide guidance on implementing Section 7 of the Executive Order *Unleashing American Energy*. This section mandates an immediate pause on the disbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which are involved in programs that conflict with the policies described in Section 2 of the Order.\n\nThe memorandum clarifies that the pause in funds primarily affects projects associated with the \"Green New Deal,\" interpreting the order as consistent due to its heading \"Terminating the Green New Deal\". The agency heads are instructed to consult with the Office of Management and Budget before resuming the disbursement of funds, ensuring alignment with the policies set forth in the Executive Order. The guidance underscores a shift in energy policy as directed by the Executive Order.",
