NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\n\nSUBJECT:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 America First Investment PolicyBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:Section1. \u00a0Principles and Objectives.\u00a0 America\u2019s investment policy is critical to our national and economic security.\u00a0 Welcoming foreign investment and strengthening the United States\u2019 world-leading private and public capital markets will be a key part of America\u2019s Golden Age. \u00a0The United States has the world\u2019s most attractive assets, in technology and across our economy, and we will make it easier for our overseas allies to support United States jobs, United States innovators, and United States economic growth with their capital.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Investment by United States allies and partners can create hundreds of thousands of jobs and significant wealth for the United States.\u00a0 Our Nation is committed to maintaining the strong, open investment environment that benefits our economy and our people, while enhancing our ability to protect the United States from new and evolving threats that can accompany foreign investment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Investment at all costs is not always in the national interest, however.\u00a0 Certain foreign adversaries, including the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries. \u00a0The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Economic security is national security. \u00a0The PRC does not allow\u00a0United States companies to take over their critical infrastructure, and the United States should not allow the PRC to take over United States critical infrastructure. \u00a0PRC-affiliated investors are targeting the crown jewels of United States technology, food supplies, farmland, minerals, natural resources, ports, and shipping terminals.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The PRC is also increasingly exploiting United States capital to\u00a0develop and modernize its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which poses significant risk to the United\u00a0States homeland and Armed Forces of the United States around the world.\u00a0 Related actions include the development and\u00a0deployment of dual-use technologies, weapons of mass destruction, advanced conventional weapons, and malicious cyber\u2011enabled actions against the United States and its people. \u00a0Through its national Military-Civil Fusion strategy, the PRC increases the size of its military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies and research institutions to support its military and intelligence activities.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Those Chinese companies also raise capital by: \u00a0selling to American investors securities that trade on American and foreign public exchanges; lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings; and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital and accompanying intangible benefits. \u00a0In this way, the PRC exploits United States investors to finance and advance the development and modernization of its military.Sec.\u00a02. \u00a0Policy.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to preserve an open investment environment to help ensure that artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies of the future are built, created, and grown right here in the United States. \u00a0Investment in our economy from our allies and partners, some of whom have tremendous sovereign wealth funds, supports the national interest. \u00a0My Administration will make the United States the world\u2019s greatest destination for investment dollars, to the benefit of all of us.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0Yet for investment in United States businesses involved in critical technology, critical infrastructure, personal data, and other sensitive areas, restrictions on foreign investors\u2019 access to United States assets will ease in proportion to their verifiable distance and independence from the predatory investment and technology-acquisition practices of the PRC and other foreign adversaries or threat actors.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 The United States will create an expedited \u201cfast-track\u201d process, based on objective standards, to facilitate greater investment from specified allied and partner sources in United States businesses involved with United States advanced technology and other important areas. \u00a0This process will allow for increased foreign investment subject to appropriate security provisions, including requirements that the specified foreign investors avoid partnering with United States foreign adversaries. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d) \u00a0My Administration will also expedite environmental reviews for any investment over $1 billion in the United States.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 The United States will reduce the exploitation of public and private sector capital, technology, and technical knowledge by foreign adversaries such as the PRC. \u00a0The United States will establish new rules to stop United States companies and investors from investing in industries that advance the PRC\u2019s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets, allowing only those investments that serve American interests.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(f)\u00a0 The United States will use all necessary legal instruments, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to restrict PRC-affiliated persons from investing in United States technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, energy, raw materials, or other strategic sectors.\u00a0 My Administration will protect United States farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities. \u00a0It will also seek, including in consultation with the Congress, to strengthen CFIUS authority over \u201cgreenfield\u201d investments, to restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence), and to expand the remit of \u201cemerging and foundational\u201d technologies addressable by CFIUS.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(g) \u00a0To reduce uncertainty for investors, reduce administrative burden, and increase Government efficiency, my\u00a0Administration will cease the use of overly bureaucratic, complex, and open-ended \u201cmitigation\u201d agreements for United\u00a0States investments from foreign adversary countries. \u00a0In\u00a0general, mitigation agreements should consist of concrete actions that companies can complete within a specific time, rather than perpetual and expensive compliance obligations.\u00a0 More administrative resources, in turn, will be directed toward facilitating investments from key partner countries.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(h)\u00a0 The United States will continue to welcome and encourage passive investments from all foreign persons. \u00a0These include non-controlling stakes and shares with no voting, board, or other governance rights and that do not confer any managerial influence, substantive decisionmaking, or non-public access to technologies or technical information, products, or services. \u00a0This will allow our cutting-edge businesses to continue to benefit from foreign investment capital, while ensuring protection of our national security.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i) \u00a0The United States will also use all necessary legal instruments to further deter United States persons from investing in the PRC\u2019s military-industrial sector. \u00a0These may include the imposition of sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) through the blocking of assets or through other actions, including actions pursuant to Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), as amended by Executive Order 13974 of January 13, 2021 (Amending Executive Order 13959 \u2014 Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies) and Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People\u2019s Republic of China), and actions pursuant to Executive Order 14105 of August 9, 2023 (Addressing United States Investments in Certain National Security Technologies and Products in Countries of Concern). \u00a0Executive Order 14105 is under review by my Administration, pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy), to examine whether it includes sufficient controls to address national security threats.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(j) \u00a0This review will build on measures taken under my authority in 2020 and 2021 and consider new or expanded restrictions on United States outbound investment in the PRC in\u00a0sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology, hypersonics, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, directed energy, and other areas implicated by the PRC\u2019s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy. \u00a0Covered sectors should be reviewed and updated regularly, including by the Office of Science and Technology Policy. \u00a0As part of the review, my Administration will consider applying restrictions on investment types including private equity, venture capital, greenfield investments, corporate expansions, and investments in publicly traded securities, from sources including pension funds, university endowments, and other limited-partner investors. \u00a0It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(k) \u00a0To further reduce incentives for United States persons to invest in our foreign adversaries, we will review whether to suspend or terminate the 1984 United States-The People\u2019s Republic of China Income Tax Convention. \u00a0That tax treaty, along with the PRC\u2019s admission to the World Trade Organization and the related undertaking by the United States to accord unconditional Most Favored Nation treatment to goods and services of the PRC, led to the deindustrialization of the United States and the technological modernization of the PRC military. \u00a0We will seek to reverse both those trends. \u00a0United States investors will invest in the future of America, not the future of the PRC.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(l) \u00a0To protect the savings of United States investors and channel them into American growth and prosperity, my Administration will also:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0determine if adequate financial auditing standards are upheld for companies covered by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii) \u00a0\u00a0review the variable interest entity and subsidiary structures used by foreign-adversary companies to trade on United States exchanges, which limit the ownership rights and protections for United States investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent behavior by these companies; and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(iii) \u00a0restore the highest fiduciary standards as required by the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, seeking to ensure that foreign adversary companies are ineligible for pension plan contributions.Sec.\u00a03. \u00a0Implementation. \u00a0The policy set forth in section 2 of this memorandum shall be implemented, to the extent permitted by law and available appropriations, and subject to internal programmatic and budgetary processes, as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a) \u00a0With

States Trade Representative, and the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to the authorities of CFIUS in coordination with the members thereof, shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, to support all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and other statutes to carry out the purposes of this memorandum.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0With respect to section 2(d) of this memorandum, the\u00a0Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, shall carry out the purposes of this memorandum.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0With respect to section 2(l)(i) of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Treasury shall engage as appropriate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; with respect to section 2(l)(ii) of this memorandum, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide a\u00a0written recommendation on the risk posed to United States investors based on the auditability, corporate oversight, and evidence of criminal or civil fraudulent behavior for all foreign adversary companies currently listed on domestic exchanges; and with respect to section 2(l)(iii) of this memorandum, the Secretary of Labor shall publish updated fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for investments in public market securities of foreign adversary companies.Sec.\u00a04. \u00a0Definition.\u00a0 For purposes of this memorandum, the term \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d includes the PRC, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region; the Republic of Cuba; the Islamic Republic of Iran; the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea; the Russian Federation; and the regime of Venezuelan politician Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sec.\u00a05. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i.) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii.) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n",
  "summary": "On February 21, 2025, the American government issued a Presidential Memorandum titled \"America First Investment Policy,\" which outlines new guidelines for foreign investment in the United States. The memorandum emphasizes preserving an open investment environment while protecting national security interests from predatory investments, particularly those originating from adversarial nations like the People's Republic of China (PRC). The policy aims to attract investments from allied nations while preventing strategic sectors from being influenced or owned by adversarial foreign entities.\n\nThis policy identifies foreign investments in critical technology and infrastructures, stressing the importance of safeguarding American assets from exploitation. Measures include restricting investments in technologies integral to the PRC\u2019s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and calling for a thorough review of existing financial agreements, such as the 1984 Income Tax Convention with China, to ensure they do not support adversarial advances. The memorandum also mandates various government departments to implement these policies effectively, promoting a secure and economically beneficial investment landscape for the United States.",
