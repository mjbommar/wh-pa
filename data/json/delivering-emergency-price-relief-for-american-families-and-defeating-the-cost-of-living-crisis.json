  "summary": "On January 20, 2025, a new presidential action was issued aiming to provide emergency price relief for American families. The statement attributes the current cost-of-living crisis to the policies of the Biden Administration, which are criticized for creating inflation through excessive government spending and stringent regulations. It claims that these policies have made essential goods expensive and scarce, particularly affecting areas like energy, housing, and automobile markets.\n\nThe action orders all executive departments and agencies to implement measures to reduce costs and enhance prosperity for American workers. Proposed actions include lowering housing costs, eliminating unnecessary expenses in healthcare, reducing costs associated with home appliances, and revising climate policies that allegedly inflate the cost of food and fuel. The President requires regular reports on the implementation of these measures every 30 days to ensure compliance and effectiveness.",
  "eli5": "The President said things have become too expensive for people because of some rules from the past. Now, new plans are being made to make things like houses and energy cheaper, so people can afford them better.",
