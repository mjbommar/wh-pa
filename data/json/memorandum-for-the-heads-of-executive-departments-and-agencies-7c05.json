  "summary": "On February 18, 2025, a memorandum was issued to the heads of executive departments and agencies in the United States. The memorandum highlights the need for radical transparency regarding wasteful spending by the federal government. It argues that too much taxpayer money is spent on programs, contracts, and grants that do not serve the American public's interests and emphasizes that citizens deserve to know how their taxes are being utilized.\n\nThe memorandum directs government agencies to disclose comprehensive details about any terminated programs, cancelled contracts, or discontinued obligations of federal funds. This disclosure should be done to the fullest extent allowed by law, ensuring that it promotes the administration's policy while complying with relevant laws, regulations, and the specific terms of the affected agreements. The overarching goal is to ensure taxpayer money is used appropriately and in support of national interests.",
