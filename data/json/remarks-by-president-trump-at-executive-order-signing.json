SCHARF:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 for decades.\u00a0 And everything will be revealed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The executive order is signed.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Give that to RFK, Jr.\u00a0 (The president gives Mr. Scharf the signing pen.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. SCHARF:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the birthright citizenship order.\u00a0 Do you have any reaction to \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Obviously, we\u2019ll appeal it.\u00a0 They put it before a certain judge \u2014 in Seattle, I guess, right?\u00a0 And\n\nthere\u2019s no surprises with that judge.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, Senators Collins and Murkowski have now said they will vote against Pete Hegseth.\u00a0 Are you worried about his confirmation, and your reaction?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 And no surprises there.\u00a0 It\u2019s too bad.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s the way \u2014 the way it is.\u00a0 Too bad.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when would you adjourn Congress to make recess appointments, Mr. President?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d take a look at that.\u00a0 I\u2019d listen to John Thune.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 We\u2019re moving along.\u00a0 The Democrats are trying to delay government, as they always do.\u00a0 They can\u2019t help themselves.\u00a0 Even John Ratcliffe, who\u2019s very, very strong, very popular and liked by the Democrats \u2014 I guess, he gets a lot of Democrat votes \u2014 that\u2019s taking a long time, and it shouldn\u2019t be taking a long time.\u00a0\n\nThey \u2014 they\u2019re maxing everything out so they can delay everything as much as possible.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does Senator Thune support an effort to use recess appointments if you choose to do that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019d be willing to use recess appointments.\u00a0 It\u2019s up to John.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\u00a0 John Thune is a great guy, great senator, knows his stuff inside out and backwards.\u00a0 But I would use recess appointments if he wants to do that.\u00a0 Absolutely.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\n\nThe Democrats are just delaying.\u00a0 They always delay.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you spoke with the Saudi crown prince yesterday.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Saudi crown prince.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How was the \u2014 the call?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 It was great.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And they said $600 million \u2014 billion dollar they can invest?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Six hundred.\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask them for a trillion.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said you\u2019re going to ask them for a trillion.\u00a0 Will Saudi Arabia be the first foreign country you will visit, since they\u2019re investing that much money?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, if they do that, I would, yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You would?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I would be glad to do that.\u00a0 I did it, as you know, four years ago.\u00a0 We did $450 billion \u2014 meaning the money all goes to American companies \u2014 and they purchased jets and they purchased computers and everything else.\u00a0 And we did $450 billion, and I guess we\u2019re at $600, $650.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nAnd I\u2019ll see if I can talk them into a trillion.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And on the Middle East again.\u00a0 You showed great confidence in Steve Witkoff.\u00a0 Why you said that you doubt that the ceasefire in Gaza will \u2014 will hold since you appraised his efforts?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, no, I think he\u2019s great.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a very tricky place.\u00a0 It\u2019s very tricky.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 And if it \u2014 if something does happen, they will not be happy.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, follow-up on that one.\u00a0 In terms of Steve Witkoff, are you going to put him in charge of \u2014 of Iran strategy?\u00a0 And do you want him talking directly with the Iranians?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, but he \u2014 he certainly is somebody I would use.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a fantastic job.\u00a0 He\u2019s a great negotiator.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very good person, great \u2014 a very popular person.\u00a0 Gets along with people.\u00a0 I have great negotiators.\u00a0 They \u2014 they have no personality whatsoever, and then I have some that do.\u00a0\n\nSteve has a wonderful way about him and people like him.\u00a0 And even in this case, both sides like him, and he was able to make a deal.\u00a0 That deal would have never been made without Steve.\u00a0\n\nThe Biden people couldn\u2019t make the deal.\u00a0 They were working on it for a year and a half.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t make a deal.\u00a0 We got it done prior to the inauguration.\u00a0 We said it has to be before the inauguration.\u00a0\n\nI mean, the deal should hold, but if it doesn\u2019t hold, there\u2019ll be a lot of problems.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Related to your AI EO.\u00a0 Just hours after you made that big Stargate announcement, Elon Musk tweeted that they don\u2019t actually have the money.\u00a0 Is that true?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if they do, but, you know, they\u2019re putting up the money.\u00a0 The government is not putting up anything.\u00a0 They\u2019re putting up money.\u00a0 They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do.\u00a0\n\nAnd, I mean, Elon doesn\u2019t like one of those people.\u00a0 So, (inaudible).\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you worried that AI is going to replace many American jobs?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does that worry you?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to also create a lot of benefits, medically, for cancer research and other things.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to have a huge positive impact.\n\nAnd, you know, we want to be ahead of China.\u00a0 We\u2019re, right now, way ahead of China.\n\nDavid Sacks is one of the all-time experts.\u00a0 You know, that \u2014 people are amazed that he \u2014 you just met him.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still here.\n\nMR. SACKS:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 There he is.\n\nBut \u2014 but one of the most respected people in that world.\u00a0 It\u2019s a world.\u00a0 That\u2019s a whole different world.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re ahead of China now because of what I\u2019m doing, and I think it\u2019s going to be very successful.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On NATO spending, please.\u00a0 You just asked the Davos forum again that NATO countries should spend 5 percent of GDP on defense.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United States don\u2019t spend 5 percent.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think so, no.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think it should also apply to the United States?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re protecting them, you know?\u00a0 They\u2019re not protecting us.\u00a0 We\u2019re protecting them.\u00a0 So, I don\u2019t think we should be spending \u2014 I\u2019m not sure we should be spending anything, but we should certainly be helping them.\u00a0 But they should \u2014 they should up their 2 percent to 5 percent, yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, you said earlier during your speech at Davos that you would like to see interest rates come down.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How much would you like to see them come down?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 A lot.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And will you talk with Powell?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see them come down a lot, and oil prices will come down.\u00a0 And when oil prices come down, everything is going to be cheaper for the American people \u2014 and actually for the world \u2014 but for the American people.\u00a0 So, I\u2019d like to see oil prices come down.\n\nAnd when the energy comes down, that\u2019s going to knock out a lot of the inflation.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to automatically bring the interest rates down.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you worried that it\u2019s too much going on at once if you\u2019re \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you said that you would demand \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you worried that there\u2019s too much going on at once if you\u2019re trying to bring interest rates down and \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 get the economy back going?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 It just works that way.\u00a0 I mean, it just economically works that way.\u00a0 When the oil comes down, it\u2019ll bring down prices, then you won\u2019t have inflation, and then the interest rates will come down.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that you would demand that the interest rates come down.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I would put in \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you expect \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I would put in a strong statement.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you expect the Fed to listen to you?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to talk to Powell about this and \u2014 bringing the rates down?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 At \u2014 at the right time, I would.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you plan to meet with any of the people you pardoned that were \u2014 participated in the January 6th, 2021, attack \u2014 do you plan to meet with any of them or meet with them at the White House?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that they probably would like to.\u00a0 I did \u2014 I did them something important.\u00a0 But what they did is they were protesting a crooked election.\u00a0 And, you know, I mean, people understand that also.\u00a0 And they were treated very badly.\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s been treated like that.\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019d be open to it, certainly.\u00a0 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know of anything like that, but I think they \u2014 they\u2019re going to \u2014 meeting some of the congresspeople \u2014 congressmen, -women \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken to them?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 who want to \u2014 want to meet.\u00a0 But I\u2019d certainly be open to it.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken to them since you issued the pardons?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken to any of them yet, but I know they\u2019re very happy.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nI gave them \u2014 I gave them their life back.\u00a0 Their life was taken away from them unnecessarily and unfairly.\u00a0 I gave them their life back.\u00a0 So, I can imagine they probably would like to.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you mean when you said that Biden took bad advice in not pardoning himself yesterday?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, he did.\u00a0 I think he did, because he \u2014 he pardoned all these people that are crooked as hell.\u00a0 Look, the congressmen, they\u2019re crooked.\u00a0 What they did is they destroyed evidence.\u00a0 When you destroy evidence, especially criminally like that \u2014 they did it criminally.\u00a0\n\nAnd the reason they destroyed the evidence is because it proved that I was right.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t destroy evidence for no reason.\u00a0 They destroyed it because they found many documents saying that I offered 10,000 soldiers.\u00a0 If they had 500 soldiers or National Guard, there would have been no problem.\u00a0 If they had 200, that would have been \u2014 I offered 10,000, if they needed them \u2014 there would have been no problem.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s been now totally disproven.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also been disproven by Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughter, who has her on tape saying it was her fault, that she has full responsibility for this.\u00a0\n\nBut \u2014 and they have all that stuff.\u00a0 They destroyed everything, and they go through a year and a half, two years of nonsense, they come up with tremendous evidence, and they destroyed evidence.\n\nAnd Schiff knew about it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why he\u2019s on there.\u00a0 He knew all about the destruction of evidence.\u00a0 A lot of people said he\u2019s the one that got them to do it.\u00a0 And he\u2019s a crooked guy \u2014 you know? \u2014 totally crooked politician.\u00a0 And so, he\u2019s pardoned, and some other people are pardoned.\u00a0\n\nAnd these are crooked politicians, every one of them.\u00a0 Bennie ~~Johnson~~ [Thompson], what he did is incredible.\u00a0 I mean, he was the leader of the committee, and he did it.\u00a0 Cheney, Crying Adam Kinzinger, all of them \u2014 they destroyed evidence and deleted everything.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s nothing with \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence now.\u00a0 They\u2019re crooked politicians, and they should be punished.\u00a0 You know, that\u2019s \u2014 even in a civil trial, you go to jail for a thing like that.\u00a0 They destroyed every document, from what I understand \u2014 every document \u2014 because it proved that I was totally innocent.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you plan to send up to 10,000 troops to the southern border, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Oh, southern border?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, the border.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 When you say \u201csouthern border\u201d \u2014 when I said \u201c10,000 troops,\u201d I was referring to the Capitol.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, I see.\u00a0 A- \u2014 and when does that \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, you got it wrong.\u00a0 I was referring \u2014\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When do you plan \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 to the Cap- \u2014\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When do you plan to do that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I offered 10,000 troops to the Capitol before January 6th.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And as for the 1,500 at the southern border, sir, to clarify, what exactly do you want them to be doing right now?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Making sure that the border is safe and secure and that criminals don\u2019t come into our country.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, do you think that sanctions on Russia will force President Putin to negotiate?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, but I think he should make a deal.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, does it bother you that Elon Musk criticized a deal that you made publicly, that he said \u2014 that he tweeted that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 He hates one of the people in the deal.\u00a0 So \u2014\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken to him since then?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 I\u2019ve \u2014 well, I\u2019ve spoken Elon but \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not about that?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to all of them, actually.\n\nNo, no.\u00a0 The people in the deal are very, very smart people.\u00a0 But Elon, one of the people he happens to hate.\u00a0 But I have certain hatreds of people too \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 you know?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, on China.\u00a0 What do you think Xi Jinping can do on the Ukraine-Russia war?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Which one?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ukraine-Rus- \u2014 -Russia war.\u00a0 What can Xi Jinping do about that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 China?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They have a lot of power over Russia.\u00a0 They supply energy to Russia, and Russia supplies energy to them.\u00a0 They supply other things to \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it\u2019s really a very big trade.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very big trading partner.\u00a0 But Russia supplies a lot of energy to China, China pays them a lot of money for that, and I think they have a lot of power over Russia.\u00a0 So, I think Russia should want to make a deal.\u00a0\n\nMaybe they want to make a deal.\u00a0 I think, from what I hear, Putin would like to see me, and we\u2019ll meet as soon as we can.\u00a0 I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d meet immediately.\u00a0 Every day we don\u2019t meet, soldiers are being killed in a battlefield, and that battl- \u2014 battlefield is like no battlefield since World War II.\u00a0 That\u2019s a \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that U- \u2014 Ukraine wants to \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I have \u2014 I have pictures that you don\u2019t want to see.\u00a0 Soldiers are being killed on a daily basis at numbers that we haven\u2019t seen in decades.\u00a0 And it would be nice to end that war.\u00a0 It\u2019s a ridiculous war.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that Ukraine is ready to make a deal.\u00a0 Did President Zelenskyy tell you that at \u2014 personally?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, sure.\u00a0 He\u2019s ready to negotiate a deal.\u00a0 He\u2019d like to stop.\u00a0 He\u2019s a \u2014 he\u2019s somebody that lost a lot of soldiers, and so did Russia \u2014 lost a lot.\u00a0 I mean, Russia lost more soldiers.\u00a0 They lost 800,000 soldiers.\u00a0 Would you say that\u2019s a lot?\u00a0 I\u2019d say it\u2019s a lot.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you said that you wanted to make Dr. King\u2019s dream a reality.\u00a0 What\u2019s your response to his children and civil rights leaders who say that your DEI orders are a contradiction of his dream and could further drive racial disparities?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you put the Houthis back on the terror list.\u00a0 How do you see the war in Yemen end now?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see what happens, but they can\u2019t shoot down our ships \u2014 the Houthis.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And that \u2014 you can\u2019t shoot down our ships or any ships, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re on the terror list, and \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 that\u2019s not good for them.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, why did you revoke security protections for former Secretary of State Mi- \u2014 Mike Pompeo and \u2014 and Brian Hook?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, the same reason I do \u2014 when you, you know, have protection, you can\u2019t have it for the rest of your life.\u00a0 Do you want to have a large detail of people guarding people for the rest of their lives?\u00a0 I mean, there\u2019s risks to everything.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think a former presidents should (inaudible) \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, would you support striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it?\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you support Israel, for example, striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities?\u00a0 Or do you \u2014\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not going to answer that.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 believe in diplomacy?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Obviously, I\u2019m not going to answer that question.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to see.\u00a0 I \u2014 I\u2019m going to be meeting with various people over the next couple of days, and we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 But hopefully that can be worked out without having to worry about it.\u00a0 It would be nice \u2014 it would really be nice if that could be worked out without having to go that further step.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And who are you going to meet with, if I \u2014 if I may ask?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d rather not say that, but very high-level people.\u00a0 But hopefully that could be worked out.\u00a0\n\nYou know, look, Iran, hopefully, will be \u2014 make a deal.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t make a deal, I guess that\u2019s okay too.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, Mr. President, just to follow up, you said you think the Fed should listen to you.\u00a0 Can you elaborate on why you think it should?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 With regard to interest rates?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Correct, yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know it certainly much better than the one who\u2019s primarily in charge of making that decision.\u00a0\n\nBut, no, I\u2019m guided by them very much, but if I disagree, I will let it be known.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, your tariffs planned for China and Mexico are much tougher \u2014 or the ones for Canada and Mexico are much tougher than the one for China.\u00a0 Why is it softer for China?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, China is already paying a lot of tariffs because of me, and when you add them up, I would say, you know, they\u2019re paying a lot.\u00a0 They paid hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 They never paid 10 cents until I came along.\u00a0 When I came along, they pay hundreds of \u2014 they\u2019ve paid hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 Never paid anything.\u00a0 And so, they\u2019ve already started at a higher base.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is February 1st \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, about the border \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 the date for Chinese tariffs as well, sir?\u00a0 February 1?\u00a0 Or was that just Mexico and Canada?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s Mexico and Canada.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019re talking about China too.\u00a0 Look, China is sending us tremendous amounts of bad drugs: fentanyl \u2014 really bad stuff.\u00a0 Most of it comes through Mexico.\u00a0 And we\u2019re losing, I s- \u2014 I think, 300,000 lives a year because of that.\u00a0 People say 150, 100, 120.\u00a0 I think 300,000 lives a year.\u00a0 Those are old numbers.\u00a0 The other \u2014 the lower number is a low number.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t have that.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got to stop sending it.\u00a0\n\nI had a deal with President Xi, but it was a deal that wasn\u2019t followed up by Biden, of course, where they were going to issue the death penalty to people that make fentanyl, and that would have stopped it.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll have to stop it with tariffs.\u00a0\n\nOkay?\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, is China (inaudible) \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
