Trump Restores American Competitiveness and Security in FCPA Enforcement \t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 10, 2025\n\n**ELIMINATING UNDUE BARRIERS TO U.S. SUCCESS:**Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to restore American competitiveness and security by ordering revised, reasonable enforcement guidelines for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977.\n    - The Order directs the Attorney General to pause FCPA actions until she issues revised FCPA enforcement guidance that promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources.       - Past and existing FCPA actions will be reviewed.\n      - Future FCPA investigations and enforcement actions will be governed by this new guidance and must be approved by the Attorney General. \n\n**AMERICAN SECURITY REQUIRES AMERICAN ECONOMIC STRENGTH:**American national security depends on America and its companies gaining strategic commercial advantages around the world, and President Trump is stopping excessive, unpredictable FCPA enforcement that makes American companies less competitive.\n    - U.S. companies are harmed by FCPA overenforcement because they are prohibited from engaging in practices common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field.\n    - Strategic advantages in critical minerals, deep-water ports, and other key infrastructure or assets around the world are critical to American national security.\n    - FCPA overenforcement infringes upon the President\u2019s Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs, necessitating this review and new enforcement policies.\n    - Over time, FCPA interpretation and enforcement by U.S. prosecutors has broadened, imposing a growing cost on our Nation\u2019s economy.       - In 2024, the DOJ and SEC filed 26 FCPA-related enforcement actions, and at least 31 companies were under investigation by year end.        - Over the past decade, there has been an average of 36 FCPA-related enforcement actions per year, draining resources from both American businesses and law enforcement. \n\n**PUTTING AMERICA FIRST:**President Trump is committed to prioritizing American economic and security interests and ensuring U.S. businesses have the tools to succeed globally.\n    - Since returning to office, President Trump has signed several executive actions aimed at enhancing American economic competitiveness, including an Executive Order to strengthen U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China to protect the American people.    a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, ensuring every new rule is justified by clear benefits\n    - President Trump renegotiated trade deals, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to secure better terms for American workers and businesses.\n    - President Trump has worked to cut burdensome regulations that hinder U.S. businesses, ensuring they can operate efficiently and competitively on the world stage.\n    - President Trump: \u201cWe have to save our country. Every policy must be geared toward that which supports the American worker, the American family, and businesses, both large and small, and allows our country to compete with other nations on a very level playing field\u2026\u201d\n",
  "summary": "President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 10, 2025, aimed at revising enforcement guidelines for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 to enhance American competitiveness and security. The order instructs the Attorney General to halt current FCPA actions until new guidelines are issued to promote fair competition and effective law enforcement. All ongoing and future FCPA-related actions will require her approval.\n\nThe initiative is driven by concerns that excessive FCPA enforcement hinders U.S. companies by preventing them from using business practices common among international competitors, thereby affecting their global competitiveness. The administration argues that strategic commercial advantages in resources and assets are vital for national security and that current FCPA enforcement overextends U.S. authority, impacting the economy and infringing on presidential powers.\n\nThis action is part of President Trump's broader strategy to prioritize American economic interests. He has signed executive actions to boost economic competitiveness, such as strengthening leadership in artificial intelligence, renegotiating trade deals, and reducing burdensome regulations. These measures are intended to ensure that U.S. businesses can effectively compete on the global stage, supporting American workers and families.",
