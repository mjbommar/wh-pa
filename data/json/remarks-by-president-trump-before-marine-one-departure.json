  "summary": "President Trump made remarks on the South Lawn before departing on Marine One on January 24, 2025. He mentioned his plan to visit North Carolina to address hurricane recovery efforts, which he felt had been neglected. Additionally, he planned to visit Los Angeles to assess fire damages, attributing the severity to water management issues. During the exchange with reporters, he responded to questions regarding his criticism of Adam Schiff, the Senate confirmation prospects of Pete Hegseth, and the March for Life event held on the same day. President Trump also mentioned a recent pardon he signed, releasing 23 individuals involved in pro-life activities.\n\nWhen asked about tariffs, particularly with Italy, President Trump made a brief but unclear remark, showing a non-committal stance. He also addressed the potential participation of reporters on his plane for the trip. The remarks were succinct, spanning only about two minutes, and included several instances of cross-talk as journalists sought answers to various questions.",
