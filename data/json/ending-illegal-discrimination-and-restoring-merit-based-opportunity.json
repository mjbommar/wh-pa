and(C)\u00a0 Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.(iii)\u00a0 In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation\u2019s civil rights laws.(iv)\u00a0\u00a0 The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award:(A)\u00a0 A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government\u2019s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and(B)\u00a0 A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.(c)\u00a0 The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance;(ii)\u00a0\u00a0 Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws;

  "summary": "On January 21, 2025, the President issued an executive order aimed at ending practices of discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunities. The order asserts that Federal civil-rights laws protect individuals from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and emphasizes the President's duty to ensure these laws are enforced. It criticizes the use of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI and DEIA) policies in major societal institutions, arguing that such practices violate civil-rights protections and threaten safety by diminishing the value of merit and hard work.\n\nThe order mandates all executive departments and agencies to terminate illegal and discriminatory DEI preferences and to enforce existing civil-rights laws. It also revokes certain previous executive orders and memoranda related to diversity and inclusion. The document emphasizes streamlining Federal contracting processes and requires compliance with anti-discrimination laws by Federal contractors and subcontractors. The order seeks to encourage the private sector to cease illegal DEI practices through agency oversight and coordinated efforts, and sets a roadmap for further actions to ensure compliance across diverse sectors.\n\nAdditionally, the order includes specific guidelines on how to handle federal procurement, education, and compliance reviews, all in line with protecting civil rights. It excludes preferences for veterans and does not prohibit First Amendment-protected speech, while setting boundaries for how such policies and practices are implemented.",
