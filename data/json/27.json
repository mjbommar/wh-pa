  "summary": "The document provides a list of Presidential Actions published on January 20, 2025. These actions cover various topics such as trade policy, security clearances, national emergencies, accountability in government positions, and international relations. Specifically, it includes directives like the 'America First Trade Policy', a memorandum to manage the backlog of security clearances, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border of the United States. Additionally, there are actions focused on holding former government officials accountable, withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, and managing foreign adversary-controlled applications like TikTok.\n\nOther crucial actions involve granting pardons for offenses related to the events at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, and delivering emergency price relief in response to the cost-of-living crisis. The document also outlines a plan to prioritize America in international environmental agreements and discusses efforts to ensure policy-influencing roles within the federal workforce are held accountable. These actions are part of a broader strategy to emphasize American interests in varied domains, both domestic and international.",
