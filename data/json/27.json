  "summary": "The document lists multiple presidential actions taken on January 20, 2025, during a period of significant policy shifts. These actions include clarifying the military's role in protecting the United States' territorial integrity, introducing an 'America First' trade policy, and addressing the backlog of security clearances within the Executive Office of the President. Furthermore, it includes a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, accountability measures for former government officials, and a restoration of accountability in policy-influencing federal positions. \n\nOther notable actions include withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, enforcing measures against foreign adversary-controlled applications with a focus on TikTok, and granting pardons related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol events. Additionally, there is a focus on prioritizing America's interests in international environmental agreements. These actions reflect a shift towards national prioritization in foreign relations, security, and environmental policies.",
  "eli5": "The President made important decisions like improving border security, changing trade rules to help the USA, and deciding how we'll deal with foreign apps like TikTok. There were also actions taken to help people in certain government jobs and make sure everyone follows rules.",
