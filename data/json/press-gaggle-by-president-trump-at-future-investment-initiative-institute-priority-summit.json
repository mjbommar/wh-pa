EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 What a great group this is.\u00a0 You have to see outside.\u00a0 It\u2019s going wild outside with a lot of love for all of us, I guess.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nBut thank you, Richard, for the introduction.\u00a0 And thank you to all for such a warm welcome.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s great to be back in beautiful Miami, where I\u2019ve actually built a lot of great buildings with the Dezer family and some others.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had tremendous success in Miami.\u00a0 We have Trump Towers in Sunny Isles Beach.\u00a0 It\u2019s four beautiful buildings right on the ocean.\u00a0\n\nThe Trump Grande \u2014 put the little E on the end for a little \u2014 class it up a little bit.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Trump Grande.\u00a0\n\nAnd the 700-acre Doral.\u00a0 That\u2019s a tremendous country club in the \u2014 it\u2019s actually the most successful country club in the U.S., where I was just given approval to build 1,500 units.\n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t care less about building units.\u00a0 When you\u2019re president, who the hell wants to build units?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019ve been building units all my life.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to build units, but they gave us permission to do it.\n\nBut today is a tremendous honor to become the first American president to address the Future Investment Initiative Institute.\u00a0 That\u2019s the first one.\u00a0 That\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s always nice.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I want to thank Mayor of Miami Francis Suarez for being here.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Francis, wherever you may be.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Hi, Francis.\u00a0 And thank you for the endorsement when I ran.\u00a0 I was very appreciative.\u00a0\n\nAlong with the mayor of Miami Beach, Steven Meiner.\u00a0 Steven, thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Steven.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\nAnd numerous American business leaders, some of the bi- \u2014 biggest business leaders, actually, anywhere in the world, and many distinguished guests from the Middle East, and, in particular, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2014 a special place with special leaders.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd including FII Institute chairman and governor of the Public Investment Fund, which is a seriously big fund, Yasir.\u00a0 I see you there.\u00a0 Stand up, Yasir.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Everyone knows Yasir. \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Great guy.\u00a0 Great, great person.\n\nAnd Finance Minister Mohammed, thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you right \u2014 thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Good to see you again.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty good: finance minister of that part of the world.\u00a0 That\u2019s not bad.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Other parts of the world, not so good, but that one is good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nAnd many other senior government leaders.\u00a0 I also want to recognize the Kingdom\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Her Royal Highness Princess Reema.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ooh, very popular.\u00a0 Very popular.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s very nice.\u00a0 Sitting next to Elon.\u00a0 Wow, that\u2019s \u2014 you couldn\u2019t do better than that, huh?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nAs well as my own special envoy to the Middle East, who has really done a fantastic job, Steve Witkoff.\u00a0 Thank you, Steve.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He\u2019s been busy.\u00a0 And Michael Waltz is here.\u00a0 Where is Michael?\u00a0 Michael has been so busy.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been going back and forth and back.\u00a0\n\nAnd a woman who was just voted the most powerful woman an- \u2014 anywhere in the world \u2014 (applause) \u2014 no, I\u2019ll go with \u2014 I\u2019m going to go with Princess Reema \u2014 but she was voted the most powerful woman anywhere in the world: Susie Wiles.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Most powerful woman, that\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0 We have to talk to you about that, Susie.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nAnd also, we all know Jared Kushner, a very special guy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Jared.\u00a0 Thank you, Jared.\n\nAnd Elon Musk.\u00a0 He\u2019s been making a little news lately, hasn\u2019t he, though?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Very positive news.\u00a0 Stand up, Elon.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a great guy.\u00a0\n\nWe did a little show last night.\u00a0 I heard that it got very good ratings, too, by the way.\u00a0 We did \u201cHannity.\u201d\u00a0 Sean Hannity was fantastic \u2014 a fantastic man, a fantastic guy, and he did a show.\u00a0 And it was great being on the show with you last night.\n\nI come today with a simple message for business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world: If you want to build the future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries, and make a fortune \u2014 because you want to make fortune; most of you have already made a fortune, I don\u2019t want to say \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 there is no better place on Earth than the current and future United States of America under a certain president named Donald J. Trump.\u00a0 I think that you\u2019re going to do very well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThey\u2019re saying that November 5th \u2014 Election Day \u2014 2024, will go down as one of the most important days in the history of our country.\u00a0 They said, \u201cIn 129 years, the most consequential election.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re right about that or not, but it sounds good.\u00a0 I wanted to see if I could get a couple of more years tacked on, but I figured the fight wasn\u2019t really worth it.\u00a0 One hundred and twenty-nine is a lot.\u00a0\n\nAnd as of January 20th, 2025, the dark days of high taxes, crushing regulations, rampant inflation, flagrant corruption, government weaponization \u2014 ooh, I know about weaponization \u2014 and total incompetence will be gone forever.\u00a0 Will be gone forever.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because the United States is back and open for business, and the golden age of America has officially begun.\u00a0 You see it happening.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nSince my election, America\u2019s economic engines have come roaring back to life in just a very short period of time.\u00a0 Think of it.\u00a0 From November 5th, the \u2014 the progress that\u2019s been made has been amazing.\u00a0 The Nasdaq is up nearly 10 percent in just a few months, and that\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 2,200 points.\u00a0\n\nAnd Bitcoin has set multiple all-time record highs, because everyone knows that I\u2019m committed to making America the crypto capital.\u00a0 We want to stay \u2014 we want to stay at the forefront of everything, and one of them is crypto.\u00a0 And Miami seems to be the center of the action, come to think of it, and maybe it\u2019ll stay there.\n\nBusiness optimism skyrocketed 42 points \u2014 think of that \u2014 in a single month.\u00a0 The most in history, by far.\u00a0 That\u2019s the biggest increase in history by not even close.\u00a0\n\nThe ISM index of manufacturing activity surged into positive territory for the first time in many years.\u00a0 Amazing.\u00a0\n\nAnd it was just announced \u2014 this is an interesting one.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t realize it was that bad for so long.\u00a0 But it was just announced by one of the nation\u2019s most historically accurate and respected pollsters, Rasmussen, that the number of Americans who believe our country is on the right track now exceeds those who think it\u2019s heading in the wrong direction for the first time in 20 years.\u00a0 Can you believe you that?\u00a0 Twenty years.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And this is really a seismic 27-point swing from just before the election.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 nobody has ever seen anything like that one, Yasir.\u00a0 I want to tell you.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big one.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nThe best and most successful business leaders on Earth are now racing to invest in the United States.\u00a0 Since November, DAMAC has announced plans to invest $40 billion in the U.S., creating at least 10,000 jobs.\u00a0 SoftBank has announced investments of between $100- and $200 billion, creating at least 100,000 American jobs.\u00a0 Oracle and OpenAI and SoftBank are now collectively committing $500 billion to keep the United States on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.\u00a0\n\nAnd so many more \u2014 I mean, so many companies, they want to come to the White House and have a little news conference all the time.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just announce it?\u201d\u00a0 But they want to come, and I\u2019ll do that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mind doing that.\u00a0 I say anytime they want to go $10 billion or more, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m there.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Ten billion or more.\n\nBut on his recent visit to the White House, the prime minister of Japan announced he anticipates Japanese investment in the United States of well over a trillion dollars, and we\u2019re working on an Alaska pipeline already, which is the closest point to Asia.\u00a0\n\nAnd as you know, the ANWR, which we\u2019ve started, Ronald Reagan couldn\u2019t get it approved.\u00a0 Nobody could get it approved for so many years.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t get it approved.\u00a0 I got it approved.\u00a0 Actually, I got it approved twice.\u00a0 I got it approved, and Biden ended it.\u00a0 That was a shocker.\u00a0 But we just got it approved again.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be \u2014 (applause) \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably the largest deposit maybe anywhere in the world, just by itself.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 they say of similar size to Saudi Arabia, so we hope that\u2019s correct.\n\nBut all of this is only happening because of the world-changing results of the 2024 election.\u00a0 We won the House.\u00a0 We won the Senate, the White House, and the Electoral College and the popular vote in a landslide.\u00a0 We also won all seven swing states, and all 50 states shifted in the Republican direction for the first time ever.\u00a0 So, every state \u2014 every single state of the 50 states shifted Republican.\u00a0 That\u2019s never happened before.\u00a0 Either way, it\u2019s never happened.\u00a0\n\nAnd 85 percent of counties voted for Trump.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 So, you have 2,600 counties versus 525.\u00a0 Two thousand six hundred, think of that.\u00a0 That\u2019s why when you look at the election map, after it was all done \u2014 the certified map \u2014 the whole thing was red \u2014 2,600 versus 500.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big, big dif- \u2014 nobody\u2019s seen anything like it, actually.\u00a0\n\nSo, as a result of this very historic victory, investors from all over the planet, once again, have confidence in America\u2019s future and respect for America\u2019s leaders, and it\u2019s about time we get a little respect.\u00a0\n\nThe last administration was the worst and most incompetent in the history of our country, but we are moving quickly to fix every single disaster Joe Biden created and make America stronger and more prosperous than ever before.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nOur first and most urgent mission is to remove the criminals that Biden allowed into our country with the ridiculous and very dangerous open-borders policy.\u00a0 They came from all over the world.\u00a0 They came from prisons and jails.\u00a0 They came from mental institutions and insane asylums.\u00a0 They were gang members.\u00a0 They were drug lords.\u00a0 They came from all over, and they were allowed to come into our country.\u00a0 And we\u2019re getting them out in record levels, just like they came in in record levels.\u00a0\n\nI want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, who is just doing \u2014 she\u2019s doing a fantastic job \u2014 governor of South Dakota \u2014 and Tom Homan, you know, and they are doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And the results are incredible.\n\nAnd every country is taking them back.\u00a0 They\u2019re sending their criminals to us, and they\u2019re all taking them back.\u00a0 We had a little problem with a couple of them.\u00a0 That ended very quickly.\u00a0 And because some said, \u201cWe don\u2019t really want MS-13 back in our country.\u201d\u00a0 But I said, \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re taking them back,\u201d and they take them back.\u00a0\n\nAnd, by the way, Europe and other places ought to start also doing that.\u00a0 They better start looking at immigration, because it\u2019s really hurting Europe very, very badly.\u00a0 And they better get smart and they better get tough before it\u2019s too late.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re also working to end the highest inflation in our country\u2019s history, all caused because they played with our energy policy and wasted money on the Green New Scam and other things such as that, and they wasted monies at \u2014 at never-seen-before levels.\u00a0 If Joe Biden had simply held federal spending at the pre-pandemic levels we had in 2019, we \u2014 right now, we would have virtually no inflation.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re trying to balance the budget immediately, and because of the tariff income, which is really go- \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s already turned out to be amazing, actually.\u00a0 It\u2019s really meant more for bringing countries and companies into our country, but it\u2019s \u2014 the numbers are rather staggering, because we\u2019re the big piggy bank that everybody wants to be.\u00a0 And they can play games, and they can say, \u201cWell, there\u2019ll be retribution and, you know, equal this and that,\u201d but they can\u2019t be equal.\u00a0\n\nBut we want to keep it so that we\u2019re the big piggy bank.\u00a0 And if we had years like we did the last four years, that wouldn\u2019t have lasted too long.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re not promising it, but you know, all of these things could happen.\u00a0 We \u2014 we hope to balance our budget.\u00a0\n\nSo, I don\u2019t want to promise it, because if I do and we come about $10 short, the fake news media back there would say, \u201cWe have breaking news.\u00a0 He did not make it.\u00a0 He did not make it.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019ll get it done very soon.\u00a0 It might not be this year, but it could be this year.\u00a0 Actually, we have a chance at getting it even this year, which people would be shocked at, because they were talking about 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now.\n\nWhen I took office last month, we inherited the consequences of inflation that was more than four times what it was when I left four years ago.\u00a0 Think of that, I left, it was at 1.4 percent.\u00a0 And the annual government spending over $1.5 trillion more than projected in 2020 alone \u2014 $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut under the Trump administration, all of that is changing faster and more dramatically than anyone ever thought possible.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t think it was possible to do what we\u2019ve done in just a very short period of time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve accomplished more in four weeks than most administrations accomplish in four years.\u00a0\n\nOn my first day in office, I imposed an immediate federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, and a foreign aid freeze.\u00a0\n\nI signed an order creating the Department of Government Efficiency and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.\u00a0 Thank you, Elon, for doing it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nAnd he\u2019s doing a great job.\u00a0 I wish you could have seen him last night.\u00a0 It\u2019s really \u2014 you know, he\u2019s a very committed person.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very serious person.\u00a0 And he\u2019s a very high-IQ people.\u00a0\n\nYou know, I like high-IQ people.\u00a0 Not all have to be, but, you know, it\u2019d be nice to have some people up there that \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 he\u2019s a seriously high-IQ individual.\u00a0 Now, he\u2019s got his faults also, I will tell you that \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but not too many of them.\n\nWhich is now really waging war on government waste, fraud, and abuse, and they\u2019re curbing inflation and saving taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every single day.\u00a0 And there\u2019s even under consideration a new concept where we give 20 percent of the DOGE savings to American citizens and 20 percent goes to paying down debt, because the numbers are incredible, Elon.\u00a0 So many billions of dollars \u2014 it\u2019s billions \u2014 hundreds of billions, and we\u2019re thinking about giving 20 percent back to the American citizens and 20 percent down to pay back debt \u2014 and pay down debt, which is \u2014 if you look at value, if it were a real estate balance sheet, the debt is tiny, but we still \u2014 we still want to pay it down.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 We don\u2019t look at it as a piece of real estate.\u00a0 It\u2019s America.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get it down through intelligence, hard work, and, as Elon said, a word called \u201ccaring.\u201d\u00a0 You have to have \u2014 you have to care.\u00a0\n\nBy doing this, Americans will tell us where there is waste.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be reporting it themselves.\u00a0 They participate in the process of saving money.\u00a0\n\nSo many of the men and women in this room, as an example, they pay tremendous amounts of taxes.\u00a0 And here are just a few examples of where your money was going before I came along.\u00a0 These are just some of the \u2014 just taken at random.\u00a0 Oh, there are much worse examples than this.\u00a0 I was just looking at them before the speech, and I can tell you there were much worse.\u00a0 And there are some that are horrible, but I don\u2019t want to really say them, because they\u2019re very, very embarrassing to people \u2014 very, very embarrassing.\u00a0 And they\u2019re really something, but you\u2019ll be seeing it and you will be reading about it.\n\nBut just some taking at random:\n\n$2 million for sex change operations in Guatemala.\n\n$20 million for \u201cSesame Street\u201d performances in Iraq.\u00a0 Twenty million, that\u2019s a lot of money.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You know, I know what it costs to do those things.\u00a0 You get a cast over for $50,000, give them a couple of bucks tip.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\u00a0 Not $20 million.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Twenty million, that\u2019s \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d on steroids.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n$101 million for 29 diversity, equity, and inclusion contracts at the Department of Education.\u00a0 Wow.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve also canceled \u2014 we\u2019ve canceled all of these, saved all of this money.\u00a0 And, again, this is just a small sample.\u00a0 This could go on.\u00a0 I could read them all day.\u00a0\n\n$520 million for a consultant \u2014 I want to know who is that consultant \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to do ESG \u2014 that\u2019s environmental, social, and governance \u2014 investments in Africa.\u00a0\n\n$25 million to promote biodiversity conservation and licit livelihoods by developing socially responsible behavior in Colombia.\u00a0\n\n$40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.\u00a0 Nobody knows what that even means.\u00a0 None of this stuff.\u00a0 Nobody.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Everyone is trying to figure out, \u201cWhat the hell does it all mean?\u201d\n\n$42 million for social and behavior changes in Uganda.\u00a0 Forty million is a lot of newspaper ads in Uganda.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n$70 million for research of evidence-based solutions for development challenges.\n\n$10 million for Mozambique medical male circumcision.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What does that \u2014 what does that mean?\n\n$2.3 million dollars for strengthening independent voices in Cambodia.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n$14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia.\n\n$486 million to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, including $22 million for inclusion \u2014 inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and $21 million for voter turnout in India.\u00a0 What do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India?\u00a0 Wow, $21 million.\u00a0 I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.\u00a0 Wow, we ought to tell the Indian government, because when we hear that Russia spent about two dollars in our country, it was a big deal.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They took \u2014 they took some Internet ads for $2,000.\u00a0 This is a total breakthrough: twenty-one million dollars for India elections.\n\n$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.\n\n$20 million for fiscal federalism, and $19 million in addition to the $21 million, for biodiversity ~~conversion~~ [conservation] in Nepal.\n\n$1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia.\u00a0 We need voter confidence too, when you read this list.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\n$14 million for social cohesion in Mali.\n\n$2.5 million for inclusive democracies in South Africa.\n\n$47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia.\u00a0 Asia is doing very well.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need to give them money.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nAnd in another program, $50 million, plus another $50 million, for condoms for Hamas.\u00a0 You know about that?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 A hundred million dollars for condoms.\u00a0 Condoms.\u00a0 Does everybody know what a condom is?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For Hamas \u2014 $100 million.\u00a0\n\nAnd these are just some.\u00a0 I could read this list all day long.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t want to bore you.\u00a0 But these are just some, and not nearly as bad as others.\u00a0 And some are just \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to say them because they\u2019re too \u2014 they\u2019re too ~~incenduary~~ [incendiary].\n\nWe\u2019re also finding tremendous abuse, waste, and fraud in Social Security.\u00a0 Social Security is \u2014 what\u2019s happening there is going to be one of the great potential scandals in history.\u00a0\n\nOn the program, there are over 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people from 100 years old to 109.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 Now, over 100, there aren\u2019t a lot of people that make it.\u00a0 Hopefully most of the people in this room will make it, but historically, you don\u2019t have thousands and thousands of people.\u00a0 But listen to this: 3.6 million people are on Social Security rolls from the age of 110 years old to 119.\u00a0 Do you think there are really that many?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Those people are seriously old.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But it gets worse.\u00a0\n\n3.47 million \u2014 3.47 million people are on Social Security from the age of 120 years old to 129 years old.\u00a0\n\n3.9 million people are on the age of Social Security from 130 years old to 139 years old.\u00a0 Now the all-time record, I heard, is a woman who was a hundred \u2014 she was 127 years old.\u00a0 That\u2019s the record.\u00a0 A woman from a certain country where they have actually people that live pretty long, actually.\u00a0 And she was 127 years old.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty old, but we\u2019re topping her by millions \u2014 millions of people.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\n3.5 million people from the age 140 to 149 years old.\u00a0\n\n1.3 million people are on Social Security from the age 150 to 159.\u00a0\n\nAnd over 130,000 people are on Social Security over the age of 160 years old \u2014 okay? \u2014 including 1,039 people \u2014 think of it \u2014 over 1,000 people \u2014 between the ages of 220 to 229.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And one person between the age of 240 to 249.\u00a0\n\nAnd the record-topper: There is one person on Social Security who is 360 years old \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 which is approximately 110 years older than our country.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0\n\nSo, what we\u2019re trying to find out and what we will find out is are people being paid from all of these.\u00a0 You know, is somebody pocketing $10,000 here, $10,000 there?\u00a0 What\u2019s going on?\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll find that out pretty easily because we have a lot of computer geniuses.\n\nI said to Elon, \u201cWho are these people that are doing this, the DOGE people?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWho are they?\u00a0 Where do they come from?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWell, number one, they love our country, and, number two, they\u2019re really genius at computers.\u201d\u00a0 So, nobody is going to fool them.\u00a0 When they go in, they see some bureaucrat that\u2019s scamming the country, and they try and talk about, you know, certain computer language, these people say, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\u00a0 These are people that are \u2014 have a natural ability as \u2014 as, you know, brilliant computer people.\n\nIt was very interesting when he told me that.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you need today.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut all of these scams have now been terminated.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, over the past month, we have effectively eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was funding much of this lunacy.\u00a0 We virtually shut down the out-of-control CFPB, escorting radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and locking the doors behind them.\u00a0 What they were doing was so terrible.\u00a0 Where they were spending the money was so terrible.\u00a0\n\nWhat we haven\u2019t looked at yet but will be is does the money come back to them, because nobody can be stupid like that.\u00a0 And they\u2019re not stupid.\u00a0 They\u2019re smart, actually.\u00a0 And, you know, why are doing that?\u00a0 Does money come back to them?\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll figure that out pretty easily, I think, and quickly.\n\nBut I\u2019ve ended all of the so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the entire federal government and private sector and notified every single government DEI officer that their jobs have been deleted.\u00a0 They\u2019re all deleted.\u00a0 And it\u2019s interesting, even these country \u2014 these companies that have tremendous \u2014 the amounts of money \u2014 a number of them just announced \u2014 Walmart, if you can believe it, they just announced that they\u2019re stopping.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, these companies are writing off, like, $220 million.\u00a0 How can you spend that much money no matter what you\u2019re doing?\u00a0 If you\u2019re teaching something, you\u2019re going to have an instructor, you\u2019re going to talk, you\u2019re going to give them a book, \u201cPlease read the book.\u201d\u00a0 You know, and then you find they spent $225 million on that.\u00a0 What\u2019s going on?\n\nAnd we were going in the wrong way, and our military was really \u2014 although, I tell you, you know, we \u2014 we defeated ISIS with our military in three weeks.\u00a0 General \u201cRazin\u201d Caine was \u2014 he\u2019s some general.\u00a0 He\u2019s a real general, not a television general.\u00a0 And three weeks \u2014 ISIS.\u00a0 And I \u2014 I asked him, and I saw some of his people that were so great, the soldiers.\u00a0 We have the greatest military in the world, but we don\u2019t have the greatest top, top leadership.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things.\u00a0\n\nBut when we want to, with proper leadership, there\u2019s nobody even close to us.\u00a0 We have the best equipment in the world.\u00a0 We make the best equipment in the world.\u00a0 But we have the best military, but, you know, we never fight to win.\u00a0 We fight to just keep it going forever.\u00a0 And when we fight to win, there\u2019s nobody that can even come close to us.\u00a0\n\nBut I was talking to General Dan Caine, and we call him \u201cRazin\u201d Caine.\u00a0 And I was told it would take about four years to defeat ISIS, and he did it in three weeks.\u00a0 I said to him, \u201cWhat do you think, General?\u00a0 How long will it take?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSir, I think we should do it in less than four weeks.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have time leftover.\u201d\u00a0 And he did.\u00a0 He did that.\u00a0 And we were told by the television generals it would take four years.\u00a0\n\nSo, we did it.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I went to Iraq.\u00a0 I flew to Iraq and \u2014 late at night \u2014 the dark of night, all the windows closed, all the lights off in the plane, in Air Force One.\u00a0 And we flew in, and it was pretty amazing.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you, we were landing, and there were no lights.\u00a0 No lights on the plane.\u00a0 \u201cSir, we have to turn off all lights.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou mean we spend $9 trillion, and we have to fly in on Air Force One with the lights off?\u201d\u00a0 And I went up to the pilot and said hello.\n\nAnd, by the way, these guys are like central casting.\u00a0 These are the best-looking human beings.\u00a0 Everybody is, like, perfect.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The most handsome people, the best-looking people you\u2019ve ever seen, with the flattops and the whole thing.\u00a0\n\nAnd I was a little concerned because the lights are off, and everything is off, and even the lights in where he was were down very dim \u2014 very, very dim with all of the lights on the fancy dashboards of the plane of Air Force One.\n\nWe\u2019re getting a new Air Force One if they can ever finish the damn thing.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We\u2019re getting two of them, actually.\u00a0 But we may have to go a different route because it\u2019s taking them a long time.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get military that\u2019s going to start building.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get people to start building properly again in our country, because they don\u2019t build properly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This was Boeing.\n\nBut we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re up there, and I\u2019m looking at these people.\u00a0 And, again, cent- \u2014 I say they look like Tom Cruise but better \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 stronger, tougher.\u00a0 And I like Tom Cruise, but these are better.\u00a0 And I said \u2014 I said, \u201cAre we okay, Captain?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes, sir, we\u2019re fine.\u201d\u00a0 But I\u2019m looking out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see any lights, and we\u2019re landing. And I\u2019m \u2014 you know, I\u2019m used to that.\u00a0 I like to sit with the pilots a lot, and I respect the pilots greatly.\n\nAnd we\u2019re up there, and, you know, we have the computer \u2014 I call it the computer voice, where it goes 1,000, 900, 800.\u00a0 That\u2019s feet \u2014 your feet above ground.\u00a0 So, that means you\u2019re very low.\u00a0 And I\u2019m looking out, and my eyes are pretty good, and I don\u2019t see any lights.\u00a0 And the computer goes out.\u00a0 It sounds like a \u2014 an intelligent individual.\u00a0 It goes, \u201c1,000.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re a thousand feet up.\u00a0 That\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s a 10-story building.\u00a0 This is a big, big plane.\u00a0 And then it goes, \u201c900, 800, 700.\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cCaptain.\u201d\u00a0 (Clears throat.)\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cCaptain, we don\u2019t see any lights.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cIs everything\u201d \u2014 \u201cYes, sir.\u00a0 Everything is fine, sir.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be landing in three minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then it goes, like, \u201c600, 500.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCaptain, are we okay?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And then it goes, \u201c400, 300, 200.\u201d\u00a0 And I\u2019m saying, \u201cMan, there\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nAnd then he goes boom.\u00a0 Perfect landing, right on this thing.\u00a0 There are no lights on the runway.\u00a0 There\u2019s no n- \u2014 I don\u2019t know how the hell they do it, but I\u2019m sure as hell glad we had somebody that knows how to fly.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nBut they didn\u2019t want to have any lights because they didn\u2019t want the enemy \u2014 after spending, you know, years and trillions of dollars, we have to land with Air Force One with no lights on the runway.\u00a0 But they were incredible people.\u00a0\n\nAnd then I got out of the plane, and I actually asked my people \u2014 you know, I said, \u201cExcuse me, I was very brave sitting in that cockpit.\u00a0 Am I allowed to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 And they said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, sir.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, I felt I was extremely brave.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nBut now here\u2019s the problem with saying a story like that.\u00a0 When you kid, the press will say, \u201cPresident Donald Trump wanted to give himself the Congressional Medal of Honor.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0 Headlines, you know?\u00a0 Headlines all over the fake news.\u00a0 We call it the fake news, but we\u2019re all wise to them.\n\nBut it was something.\u00a0\n\nAnd then I went down, and it was the same thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m standing on the top, and I look down and there\u2019s these handsome people.\u00a0 Everybody is like from a movie set.\u00a0 Good-looking guys.\u00a0 I get down the stairs, and \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMy name is Caine, sir.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s your first name?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThey call me \u2018Razin.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cWait a minute.\u00a0 Your name is Razin Caine?\u00a0 I love you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been looking for you for five years.\u00a0 You are the grea-\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cThis is what I want.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd there was a general next to him.\u00a0 There was a colonel.\u00a0 There was a drill sergeant, a master sergeant.\u00a0 They were all, like, people \u2014 I could make a movie right now.\u00a0 I\u2019d have the best-looking people ever.\u00a0 And they were great.\u00a0\n\nAnd then I went in, and \u201cSir, would you like to rest before the me-\u201d \u2014 \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to rest.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to rest.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been resting on the plane,\u201d other than the last few moments, which were quite harrowing.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to rest.\u201d\u00a0 He was thinking about Biden in advance, you know?\u00a0 Biden would have gone there; he would have rested for days.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They \u2014 and then they wouldn\u2019t have had a meeting.\u00a0 He\u2019d just go home.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nNo, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to rest.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to rest at all.\u00a0 I want to go.\u201d\n\nSo, we went into this, like, bunker, and we had a lot of very good, talented people.\u00a0 And that\u2019s when I asked him.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m hearing it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right, sir.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to take a long time.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have it done in four weeks.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cHow can you say four weeks when, in Washington, they said four years?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cIt\u2019s four weeks, sir.\u00a0 We\u2019ll hit them left.\u00a0 We\u2019ll hit them right.\u00a0 We\u2019ll hit them up the center.\u00a0 We\u2019ll hit them underground and overground.\u00a0 We\u2019ll knock the hell out of them, sir.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd I said, \u201cWhy is it that they said so long?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cBecause they wouldn\u2019t let us fight, and we\u2019re very far away.\u00a0 They want us to fight for this \u2014 from this airport.\u00a0 We\u2019re very, very far away, sir, and they want us to fight here.\u00a0 We have many substations out\u201d \u2014 sub-airports, they call them.\u00a0 Remote airports, where they build them in the sand.\u00a0 \u201cAnd we have many of them, and I\u2019d use them all, sir, and I would hit them so hard from so many different directions.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou just let me know.\u201d\u00a0 And I called him back, and I said, \u201cGo ahead and do it.\u00a0 Are you sure you can do this, General?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u00a0 And he did it, actually, in three weeks.\u00a0 It was over.\u00a0 A hundred percent of people that are really hurting the Middle East, hurting the world \u2014 and it was done.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, we have the greatest military in the world, but you have to use the right people.\u00a0 But there\u2019s nothing like what they were able to do in that case.\u00a0 And in other cases, wherever I gave them something, it was done incredibly well and very \u2014 and you know many of the instances, because it\u2019s been well reported.\n\nBut we\u2019ve also required \u2014 and we ha- \u2014 so, we have a country that\u2019s a great country.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong country, but it\u2019s a country that\u2019s just now gaining its respect back to the levels that it should \u2014 should have never lost.\u00a0 We were being laughed at by the entire world, but we\u2019re not being laughed at anymore.\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019ve also required that all federal employees must once again show up to work.\u00a0 This is a new phenomenon, you know, since COVID.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Show up to work in person like the rest of us.\u00a0 So, I mean, it doesn\u2019t work when you don\u2019t show up.\u00a0\n\nAnd I see companies now are all going back to it.\u00a0 They\u2019re all going back.\u00a0 It\u2019s great.\u00a0 I want some of the big business leaders saying, \u201cWe absolutely are going back.\u201d\u00a0 You \u2014 you j- \u2014 you can\u2019t work at home.\u00a0 They\u2019re not working.\u00a0 They\u2019re playing tennis, they\u2019re playing golf, or they have other jobs, but they\u2019re not working \u2014 or they\u2019re certainly not working hard.\u00a0 You could never build a company or a country with that.\u00a0\n\nSo, we have a very strong policy.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t show up to work, they \u2014 they get fired.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re trying to make our government smaller but much stronger.\u00a0 And we have tremendous bureaucracy, but it\u2019s happening.\u00a0 A lot of people are leaving and, in some cases, leaving with pretty good offers.\u00a0 You know, you\u2019re paid seven or eight months and go out, find a job.\u00a0 But some of these people had jobs.\u00a0 They were actually working for us, but they also had other jobs.\u00a0 And those people, in theory, they have problems.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to do anything about that.\u00a0 So, we have other things to do, but they were working other jobs instead of working for us.\u00a0 So, they were staying home working, but they were working other jobs, getting paid a lot of money, perhaps.\u00a0\n\nWe offered deferred resignation buyouts to all federal workers, resulting in more than 75,000 bureaucrats voluntarily surrendering their taxpayer-funded jobs.\u00a0 A lot of them are leaving because they don\u2019t want to be caught having the second job, some are leaving because they didn\u2019t want to be in government any longer, and \u2014 and some are leaving because they didn\u2019t want to show up to work.\u00a0 They wanted to work outside of an office, and that\u2019s never going to work for anybody, including companies.\u00a0 The companies ought to get smart.\u00a0\n\nYou watch these companies where they do that: They start going bad.\u00a0 Nobody knows \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with this company?\u201d\u00a0 Well, try getting the people back into the office where they can be cohesive and together.\u00a0\n\nIn less than a single month, the Department of Government Efficiency has already saved over 55- \u2014 this is just a short period of time \u2014 $55 billion, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 That\u2019s nothing compared to the numbers that you\u2019re talking about, right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re ending trillions of dollars in waste, and it\u2019ll mean much lower inflation; lower interest rates; lower payments on mortgages, credit cards, car loans; and much higher stock markets.\u00a0 I think the stock market is going to be great.\u00a0 In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government, and we have to do it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m also taking fast action to end the radical left\u2019s nation-wrecking crusade against oil and natural gas.\u00a0 Over the past four years, the Biden administration cut the number of new oil leases and gas leases by 95 percent.\u00a0 They slowed new pipeline.\u00a0\n\nI mean, look at the \u2014 any one.\u00a0 Dakota Access, they wanted that one knocked out.\u00a0 The Keystone Pipeline, they wanted that one knocked out.\u00a0 They ended the Keystone.\u00a0 We got the Dakota Access done, but it wasn\u2019t easy after they tried to stop it.\n\nThey slowed new oil and gas pipeline construction to virtually a halt.\u00a0 They shut down 38 percent of active oil and gas rigs in the United States.\u00a0\n\nBut they love the wind turbines.\u00a0 They go round and round and round.\u00a0 And if the wind doesn\u2019t blow, they got problems.\u00a0 They kill all the birds.\u00a0 They ruin the sight lines.\u00a0 They ruin the plains and the beautiful areas of our country, including the oceans, the lakes.\u00a0\n\nThey closed more than 50 power plants, all causing energy prices to skyrocket.\u00a0 You saw that happen.\u00a0 That\u2019s what caused the inflation.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty easy.\u00a0\n\nThese policies were so destructive that despite draining nearly 40 percent of U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve meant for emergencies \u2014 it was meant for emergencies.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t meant for getting the price of gasoline down so that you can win an election.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t work for winning the election.\u00a0 Actually, there\u2019s so many people that are driving that it\u2019s a very small number.\u00a0 It just had a very small effect.\u00a0 But in the meantime, it takes it down.\u00a0 It\u2019s at \u2014 now it\u2019s at the lo- \u2014 we\u2019ll fill it up fast, but it\u2019s at the lowest level.\u00a0\n\nWhen we made the transition, it was at the lowest level in history ever recorded.\u00a0 It\u2019s the lowest level.\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s ever seen it that way.\u00a0 They \u2014 they put it all out because they thought they could keep gasoline prices down a little bit.\u00a0 Just go past the election, and then after that, they didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 And it didn\u2019t work, because they didn\u2019t get elected.\u00a0 I got elected.\n\nBut the price of gasoline still rose over 35 percent and, in some cases, at some periods, it was 100 percent and 125 percent during certain periods of time.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, we have implemented a very different plan.\u00a0 You probably heard of it.\u00a0 It\u2019s called drill, baby, drill, and we\u2019re doing a \u2014 (applause).\n\nThe world runs on low-cost energy, and energy-producing nations like us have nothing to apologize for.\u00a0 We have more energy than any other nation in the world, and we\u2019re going to use it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to use it on AI plants.\u00a0\n\nI was telling some of the people that came in that \u2014 you know, they\u2019re very inter- \u2014 everybody\u2019s talking about AI.\u00a0 I hope you\u2019re right.\u00a0 You know, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nBut, Elon, are they right?\u00a0 Are they right in going all i- \u2014 they are all in for AI.\u00a0\n\nBut the problem is, to do it, just in our country, you need twice the electricity just to open up and be the top of AI.\u00a0 You need twice the electricity that we have right now.\u00a0 In the entire country, if you take all of the electricity, you need more than twice.\u00a0 You need twice.\u00a0 You need double what we have right now just to fuel this new industry that\u2019s growing.\u00a0 I was amazed when I heard that number.\n\nAnd they all said, \u201cHow can we do this?\u201d\u00a0 Because, you know, in China and various other places, you can probably get it with the shake of a hand, but in our country, you can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nBut now you can, because we\u2019ve declared \u2014 I\u2019m declaring a national emergency in order to get fast approvals.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have \u2014 if you build a plant, you\u2019re able to build an electric-generating facility right next to your plant, so you\u2019ll be making your own.\u00a0 You won\u2019t have to count on utilities.\u00a0 You won\u2019t have to count on an old grid that could fail, could get hit by something \u2014 bad things or good things \u2014 but you\u2019re not going to have to \u2014 you\u2019re not going to have to worry about grids.\u00a0 You\u2019re not going to have \u2014 you\u2019ll build your plant, and you\u2019ll build your \u2014 your \u2014 essentially, you become a utility, in a way. \u00a0You build your own electricity.\u00a0 If you want to build extra and put it out and get paid for that, you\u2019re going to be able to do that.\u00a0 You could put it back into the grid, but you\u2019re going to be able to build with your plant a generating facility.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to get you Lee Zeldin, head of the environment \u2014 head of Environmental \u2014 the Environmental group \u2014 various groups.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got them unified now, but we\u2019re going to get you very fast approvals, and they\u2019ll be approved so fast your head will spin.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to get that whole industry started, and we\u2019re going to be the head of it.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading right now.\u00a0 We have the greatest brain power.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading right now, and I expect that we\u2019re going to be leading by a lot.\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019re going to get you the energy very, very quickly.\u00a0 That would be the one thing that everybody was concerned, \u201cHow do we have that much electricity when Los Angeles has blackouts and brownouts right now, and there\u2019s a lack of electricity?\u201d\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to get it at levels never seen before.\u00a0\n\nI ended the ridiculous Green New Scam, halting tens of billions of dollars of wasteful deficit spending.\u00a0 And I withdrew the United States from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord.\u00a0\n\nAnd I ended Joe Biden\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate, because it was just insane.\u00a0 I repealed the last \u2014 and, by the way, if you want to buy an electric car, that\u2019s great.\u00a0 If you want to buy a gasoline-driven car or a hybrid, it\u2019s great.\u00a0 Whatever the \u2014 whatever the thing happens to be.\u00a0\n\nI heard hydrogen is hot.\u00a0 The problem is, when it\u2019s not, you\u2019re in deep trouble.\u00a0 Because when that sucker blows up, they don\u2019t find the body.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, that\u2019s one that I said, \u201cYou know what?\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a pass on that one.\u201d\u00a0 They said it\u2019s good, but when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s really bad.\u00a0 You find the bodies on trees \u2014 on the side of a tree.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll pass on that one.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to want that one.\u201d\u00a0 But you never know.\u00a0 Maybe someday it\u2019ll be good.\u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s off to a good start.\u00a0\n\nI repealed the last administration\u2019s very destructive natural gas export ban, and, last week, we approved our first new liquefied natural gas export license, and we have literally hundreds of people that want to export.\u00a0\n\nI recently met with the Japanese prime minister, Ishiba, to discuss large increases in American oil and gas exports.\u00a0 They want it so badly.\u00a0 They said, \u201cWe went to the Biden administration, and they wouldn\u2019t sell it.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t sell it.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody knows why.\u00a0 Biden didn\u2019t know why either.\u00a0 They asked him.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cHe wanted \u2014 they did?\u00a0 Oh, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019re going to sell it.\u00a0 And the new project in Alaska is going to feed all of Asia.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to take care of all of Asia.\u00a0 We have so much oil and gas, like very few people \u2014 like very few countries have \u2014 like, really, actually, no country has.\u00a0\n\nI also met with Prime Minister Modi of India, who wants to greatly expand India\u2019s purchase of American energy.\u00a0\n\nAnd my administration has also launched the most aggressive deregulation program of any nation in history.\u00a0 Under my executive order, for every 1 new regulation added, 10 old regulations have to be eliminated.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd, you know, in our first term, which was actually an incredible success \u2014 we had the greatest economy in history until COVID, and even after that, we did great.\u00a0 The stock market was higher.\u00a0 If you think of it, it was higher after the fact \u2014 after we went through that whole thing, it was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in, which is a pretty amazing thing.\u00a0\n\nBut we did a great job on that, but it was a terrible thing for the world.\u00a0 The whole world suffered.\u00a0 It suffered terribly, including China, including other countries.\u00a0 It just was a terrible period of time.\u00a0\n\nBut despite that, we did well.\u00a0 But we had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and I think this time we\u2019re going to do even better.\u00a0 We had \u2014 we were artificially hurt by COVID.\u00a0 We had to focus on that instead of focusing on \u2014 but just prior to COVID coming in, there\u2019s never been anything like what we did, what we achieved.\u00a0 And even after, we did very well con- \u2014 and especially considering what all of us had to do with COVID.\u00a0 Some nations were hit so badly, it was \u2014 it was just unbelievable what happened to them.\u00a0\n\nAs part of our effort, I\u2019ve signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden\u2019s war on Bitcoin and crypto.\u00a0 We ended that war totally.\u00a0 That war is over.\u00a0 They were very hostile toward them until the very end, just because there are so many people on Bitcoin and crypto that \u2014 just before the end, the SEC came out, and they were being very nice.\u00a0 I was so nice to people, because so many people were being indicted for no reason whatsoever \u2014 very political group of people.\u00a0 That\u2019s all they did was they liked indicting people.\u00a0\n\nBut they were being indicted, and many of those indictments were dropped just before the election because they said, \u201cWait a minute.\u00a0 There\u2019s 100 million, 125 million people using this,\u201d and they didn\u2019t want to have, you know, all these people being \u2014 voting against.\u00a0 But by the time they did that, it was too late.\u00a0 We had that vote entirely, I think.\u00a0 I think anybody would \u2014 smart that believed in that, and there were a lot of people believing it \u2014 anybody that was smart voted for Trump.\n\nAnd they pulled the indictments.\u00a0 And I see people that were indicted.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI saved your life.\u00a0 I saved your life.\u201d\u00a0 Because if they thought that \u2014 they actually thought that I was doing \u2014 they said, \u201cWhy is Trump doing it?\u00a0 Is he doing it for political reasons?\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t do anything for political reasons.\u00a0 I do what\u2019s right.\u00a0 I do \u2014 I want to be on the forefront of every industry.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019ll be working with the Republican Congress to pass the largest tax cuts in American history.\u00a0 And that includes, obviously \u2014 (applause) \u2014 yeah.\u00a0 That includes we have to extend the Trump tax cuts, which were, until now, the largest.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to dramatically cut taxes for families and for workers and for companies, including no tax on tips and hopefully no tax on Social Security and no tax on overtime.\u00a0 And that overtime one is a sleeper, because I think a lot of people are going to be spurred on to do a lot of extra work.\u00a0 When they hear that, it\u2019s \u2014 a lot of companies really like it and a lot of people really like it.\u00a0\n\nThe new Trump tax cuts will also include 100 percent expensing for new factory construction in the United States and anything else that you\u2019re going to buy with capital.\u00a0 If you buy something \u2014 if you buy something that is going to be good for our country, we\u2019re going to let you expense it \u2014 one-year expense.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I did that the first time, and everybody was saying, \u201cCan you go back to that?\u201d\u00a0 Now you still get, I guess, 40 percent or whatever, but it, you know, pares down.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to bring that right up to the \u2014 to the top level.\u00a0 I think that had a lot to do with the success that I had during my first term.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019ll substantially cut taxes for all domestic producers of oil and gas and just about everything else that they produce.\u00a0\n\nIn my first term, I brought the business tax down from around 40 percent to 21 percent, which everybody said was an impossible thing to do.\u00a0 I cut it from 40 or \u2014 it actually \u2014 with state and city, it was much higher than 40, but I got it down to 21 percent.\u00a0 And now I\u2019m bringing it down to a goal of 15 percent, but only if you make your product in America.\u00a0 In other words, you\u2019re going to be at 21 percent, but if you make your product in America, you\u2019re going to go from 21 to 15.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to pay 21 percent, which is still lower than anything.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nSo, guys like Elon are going to come and make his great cars in the United States.\u00a0 There \u2014 a lot of \u2014 a lot of people will.\u00a0 A lot of people are calling.\u00a0 A lot of car companies are calling.\u00a0 They called me \u2014 three of them.\u00a0 Three of the majors, they called, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking all over the place.\u00a0 We want to be there.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals \u2014 drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber, probably, and some other things over the next month or sooner, and it\u2019s going to have a big impact on America.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing our businesses back.\u00a0\n\nIf they don\u2019t make their product in America, then they \u2014 very simply, they have to pay a tariff.\u00a0 But if they do make their product in America, they ha- \u2014 they don\u2019t have to pay any tariff, which will bring \u2014 it\u2019s all going to bring trillions of dollars into our Treasury, or it\u2019s going to mean that there won\u2019t be any taxes because we won\u2019t have a fair base.\u00a0 If they don\u2019t have it, we don\u2019t have it.\u00a0 If they don\u2019t pay \u2014 if they don\u2019t charge us, we don\u2019t charge them.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty simple.\u00a0\n\nThe Republican Party is, once again, the party of common sense.\u00a0 We\u2019re a party of common sense.\u00a0 We want strong borders.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want men playing in women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to have transgender for everybody.\u00a0 We\u2019re the party of common sense.\u00a0 That\u2019s how we won the election in such a big manner.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll no longer allow other countries to ransack and plunder our nation.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019ve announced that we will soon begin imposing reciprocal tariffs on any country that engages in unfair and unequal trading practices.\u00a0 If they tariff us, as I said, we will tariff them at the exact same rate.\u00a0 So, if a certain country \u2014 because some of these countries, even countries that I\u2019ve already mentioned, are extremely aggressive with tariffs.\u00a0 Nobody knows that.\u00a0\n\nThe European Union, they have a VAT tax that\u2019s devastating.\u00a0 It\u2019s very tough for people on the outside.\u00a0 Hard to sell cars.\u00a0 Really impossible to sell them, because they also have nonmonetary tariffs that are very, very tough.\u00a0 But if you take a look at that, it\u2019s a very unfair situation.\u00a0 And the VAT tax is similar to the tariff.\n\nAround the world, I\u2019m moving quickly to end wars, settle conflicts, and restore the planet to peace.\u00a0 I want peace, and I don\u2019t want to see these \u2014 everybody being killed.\u00a0 And you take a look at the death in the Middle East and the death that\u2019s taking place between Russia and Ukraine that\u2019s been going on, and we\u2019re going to end it.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you\u2019re not so far away from it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you right now, you\u2019re not so far away.\u00a0 If we would have had this administration for another year, you would have been in World War III, and now it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nIn the Middle East, I\u2019ve restored my policy of maximum pressure on Iran, designed to \u2014 to bring peace.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we\u2019ve designated the Houthis a terrorist organization.\u00a0 They\u2019re, you know, destroying shipping lanes all over the place.\u00a0 They\u2019re making it very hard for people to get their product delivered.\u00a0 They\u2019re making it very difficult.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll take care of that situation.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we\u2019re bringing in the hostages, and we\u2019re bringing them home to their families.\u00a0 Some of them are in pretty bad shape, I have to tell you.\u00a0\n\nTo end the horrible war in Ukraine, I have spoken with President Putin and President Zelenskyy, and our teams began negotiations this week in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 I want to thank Saudi Arabia for that.\u00a0 That was so great.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\n\nAnd I want to thank, in particular \u2014 I mean, we have so many of the people \u2014 Yasir, Mohammed, all the people \u2014 but \u2014 but, in particular, we have to thank Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting these historic talks \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and talks that went very, very well.\u00a0\n\nSteve was there \u2014 Steve Witkoff was there, and Michael was there \u2014 Michael Waltz \u2014 and others.\u00a0 And they really went well.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big \u2014 it\u2019s a big step.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to get that war over with.\u00a0\n\nYou have to see the people that are dying.\u00a0 I look at the pictures, the \u2014 the satellite pictures of the field.\u00a0 It\u2019s a level field, and it looks like a modern-day version of Gettysburg, and you know what that means.\u00a0 It is just carnage.\u00a0 It\u2019s horrible.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s not American soldiers.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even soldiers from the Middle East, in the case of Ukraine-Russia, but it\u2019s people.\u00a0 It\u2019s young people from Russia and Ukraine, mostly, that are just being decimated.\u00a0 It\u2019s flat fields, and a bullet goes, and a bullet only stops when it hits somebody.\u00a0 And the level of people being killed in that battle \u2014 soldiers, young soldiers \u2014 in some cases, old soldiers, because they\u2019re running out of people; they\u2019re running out of soldiers, one case.\u00a0\n\nBut think of it, a modestly successful comedian, President Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a war that basically couldn\u2019t be won, that never had to start, and never would have started if I was president \u2014 not even a chance.\u00a0 And it didn\u2019t start for four years.\u00a0 Never would have started.\u00a0\n\nBut a war that he, without the U.S. and Trump, will never be able to settle.\u00a0 They\u2019ll never settle that war without our involvement.\u00a0 That\u2019s why they did such a great job this weekend.\u00a0 That\u2019s why Saudi Arabia did such a great job this weekend in hosting.\n\nThe United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe, and Europe\u2019s money is guaranteed.\u00a0 They get their money back.\u00a0 It\u2019s a form of a loan.\u00a0 Nobody knows that.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t somebody saying, you know, we do it the same way?\u201d\u00a0 And we spent much more money.\u00a0 We have to equalize.\u00a0\n\nBut while the United States gets nothing back \u2014 so, they get their money back.\u00a0 It\u2019s a loan.\u00a0 We just give our money.\u00a0\n\nAnd we had a deal based on rare earth and things, but they broke that deal.\u00a0 But we \u2014 they broke it two days ago.\u00a0 We had a deal, because I said, \u201cWe\u2019re spending $350 billion, and Europe gets their money back in the form of a loan and we don\u2019t.\u00a0 We\u2019re just giving the money hand over fist.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s the Biden administration for you.\u00a0 But they\u2019re no longer dealing with the same United States as they were dealing with a few months ago.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t crooked Joe Biden demand equalization?\u00a0\n\nAnd that this war is far more important to Europe than it is to us, and that there\u2019s a very big, beautiful ocean as separation.\u00a0 This is \u2014 you know, we\u2019re helping Europe.\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to help Europe.\u00a0\n\nOn top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money that we sent them is missing.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know where the money is.\u00a0 He said, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know where half of it is.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Wonderful.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nHe refuses to have elections.\u00a0 He\u2019s low in the real Ukrainian polls.\u00a0 I mean, how can you be high with every city is being demolished?\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to be high.\u00a0 Somebody said, \u201cOh, no, his polls are good.\u201d\u00a0 Give me a break.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Every city is being demolished.\u00a0 They look like a demolition site, every single one of them.\u00a0\n\nAnd the only thing he was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle.\u00a0 He played him like a fiddle.\u00a0 That\u2019s an expression we use, Yasir, to say that he\u2019s pretty easy.\u00a0 Pretty easy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nA dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he\u2019s not going to have a country left.\u00a0 Got to move.\u00a0 Got to move fast, because that war is going in the wrong direction.\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia \u2014 something all admit that only Trump is going to be able to do and the Trump administration.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be able to do it.\u00a0 I think Putin even admitted that.\n\nBiden never tried.\u00a0 Europe has failed to bring peace.\u00a0 And Zelenskyy probably wants to \u2014 maybe he wants to keep the gravy train going.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the problem, but he hasn\u2019t been able to \u2014 he\u2019s very upset that he wasn\u2019t invited \u2014 he could have come if he wanted to \u2014 but that he wasn\u2019t invited to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 But he\u2019s been working for three years.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been even meetings or phone calls to stop this war.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a horrible thing.\u00a0 I figure Russia has lost 900,000 soldiers.\u00a0 I think that Ukraine has lost probably 700,000, and it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see body parts \u2014 bodies and body parts all over the field.\u00a0 All over.\u00a0 We see them through \u2014 very accurately through satellites.\u00a0\n\nI love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job.\u00a0 His country is shattered, and millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died.\u00a0 And you can\u2019t bring a war to an end if you don\u2019t talk to both sides.\u00a0 You got to talk.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t been talking for three years.\u00a0\n\nSo, we hope to see a ceasefire soon and to reestablish stability in Europe and the Middle East.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nBut as I \u2014 thank you very much.\u00a0 And as I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s my hope that my greatest legacy will be as a peacemaker and a unifier.\u00a0 That would be a great legacy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nSo, in conclusion, the golden age of America is upon us, and I\u2019m inviting everyone here today and every citizen across our land to take part in the most extraordinary period of peace, prosperity, growth, innovation, wealth creation, and expansion the world has ever seen.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re on our way.\u00a0 I mean, everyone is talking about us.\u00a0 Three weeks.\u00a0 We\u2019re in there for a couple of days more than three weeks, and everyone is talking about it.\u00a0 You have to see the crowds of people outside.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty amazing what\u2019s happening.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re on the verge of soaring markets, surging incomes, booming production, groundbreaking technologies, thrilling discoveries, and a quantum leap in the quality of life.\u00a0 Absolutely, a quantum leap.\u00a0\n\nOne day very soon, our country will have the greatest economy in the history of the world, because we once again have a president who puts America first.\u00a0 And we put America first, and your country should put your country first, but in the end, we want America first.\u00a0 And when it\u2019s all beautiful, which it\u2019s going to be pretty soon, we want to help other countries and you want to help other countries.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, I tell your leaders \u2014 and some of the leaders are in this room right now \u2014 you got to put your country first.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s Saudi Arabia, whether it\u2019s something else, you\u2019re going to put your country first, but we\u2019re going to have plenty left over to help others also.\u00a0\n\nAs long as you invest in America, build in America, and hire in America, that means that I\u2019m fighting for you.\u00a0 I am fighting very hard for you.\n\nTogether, we\u2019re going to make the United States of America bigger, better, bolder, richer, and greater than ever before.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be stronger than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be a peacemaker and a peacekeeper.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we\u2019ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far.\u00a0 And if it ever came to war, there is nobody that will be able to come close to us, but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to ever happen.\u00a0\n\nSo, I want to thank you all very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to be here.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think somebody said they\u2019re going to ask questions, and I didn\u2019t say, \u201cGee, what are the questions,\u201d like Biden does.\u00a0 I say, \u201cJust ask.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u00a0 You ask a question, and I give an answer.\u00a0\n\nSo, I think, Richard, you\u2019re going to come up and you\u2019re going to give me some questions.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 Please, a round of applause for the president of United States of America.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you for accepting to take a few questions.\u00a0 Twenty years ago, I don\u2019t know if you will remember, we were under the same roof in Orlando, and you were delivering an amazing speech in front of 3,000 sales rep, giving them the best advice to be successful.\u00a0 So, what is the best piece of advice that you have ever received?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think it was watching my father.\u00a0 You know, my father was a very hard worker, and he just worked hard and he was very smart.\u00a0 He had good genetics.\u00a0 His brother was the longest-serving professor in the history of MIT, Dr. John Trump.\u00a0 And my father was every bit as smart, but my father was \u2014 had to work.\u00a0\n\nHe was older, and he put his brother through school.\u00a0 In fact, he once said, \u201cBoy, I put him through so much school.\u201d\u00a0 He had three different degrees, and they asked him to stay on at MIT.\u00a0 But my father was the same ilk.\u00a0\n\nAnd I noticed that my father was a happy man, and what he did is he worked.\u00a0 He just worked all the time.\u00a0 He worked, worked, worked, and he loved it.\u00a0\n\nAnd, really, I think the best piece of advice I got from that is you have to love what you do, and if you love what you do, you\u2019re going to have a happy life.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I see so many people, they\u2019re in businesses that they don\u2019t want to be in.\u00a0 They\u2019re in businesses that, you know, they\u2019re bored in or they\u2019re not good at, they don\u2019t have a natural ability at it.\u00a0 There is such a thing as natural ability, whether it\u2019s sports or acting or anything else.\u00a0 I mean, some people have an ability for something.\u00a0 Try and find that ability.\n\nBut you have to love what you do.\u00a0 If you love what you do, you\u2019re going to be \u2014 at least you have a good chance of being successful.\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Mr. President, it\u2019s almost time for \u2014 (applause) \u2014 for an early dinner.\u00a0 So, if you are throwing a dinner party, and you can invite three fascinating guests, living or dead, who would you bring?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, they\u2019re all sitting right in the front row.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Yasir, are you ready? Mohammed, are you ready?\u00a0 Steve Witkoff.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have Mr. \u2014 the most important person, at least until the World Cup is over, is here.\u00a0 Gianni, stand up.\u00a0 He gave the United States the World Cup.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Gianni, thank you very mu- \u2014 I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u00a0 That\u2019s very good.\u00a0 He\u2019s the king of soccer.\u00a0 That\u2019s not bad.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\n\nYou know, but it\u2019s very interesting, when I was president, I got the World Cup and I got all of the \u2014 you know, we have the 250 anniversary, so that fell in this administration.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big deal: 250 years.\u00a0 But we have all of these things happening, and I also got the Olympics.\u00a0\n\nAnd I was called by the mayor of Los Angeles, \u201cSir, would you call up the Olympic Committee because\u201d \u2014 it was at that time \u2014 \u201cPresident Obama will not take their phone call.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to get the Olympics in Los Angeles.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd, by the way, they\u2019ve recommitted to Los Angeles at a level that \u2014 you know, I was very worried about that.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve \u2014 the opposite.\u00a0 You know, somebody could have said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to do it someplace else until\u201d \u2014 they have actually recommitted.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to make it bigger and better than ever.\u00a0 So, I want to let you know that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nBut I got \u2014 I had the Olympics.\u00a0 So, I got the Olympics.\u00a0 I got the World Cup, and I said \u2014 and the 250, but that one I didn\u2019t get.\u00a0 But it was there.\u00a0 It was in this term.\u00a0\n\nAnd I ran an election, and we did fantastic in 2016.\u00a0 We did much better \u2014 millions and millions \u2014 tens of millions, but millions and millions of votes better.\u00a0 And bad things happened, and I didn\u2019t get that one.\u00a0\n\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know\u201d \u2014 when I originally signed the Olympics, I said, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to even be president, and I got the Olympics,\u201d because if I didn\u2019t \u2014 when I spoke with the people \u2014 the organizing committee and the people in different parts of the world \u2014 they asked me to do it because the president wouldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I was president-elect, and I gave them a talk.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t get them off the phone.\u00a0 They were starving for love.\u00a0 And the bottom line: They gave us the Olympics.\u00a0\n\nAnd I said, \u201cYou know, isn\u2019t it sad I won\u2019t be president?\u201d\u00a0 Then we had the election result, and now I\u2019m president for the Olympics and for the World Cup.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So, I\u2019m very happy about that, Gianni.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nThank you, G- \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 I\u2019ll be there.\u00a0 I promise, I\u2019ll be there.\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 And, by the way, Mr. President, backstage, you have a gift from Gianni.\u00a0 He gave us the first ball with your name \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ooh \u2014\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 \u2014 which will be played for the cup \u2014 World Cup in America.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be great.\u00a0 Thank you, Gianni, very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 I doubt that any day you will take a sabbatical year, but if you could take a sabbatical year, Mr.\u00a0 President, what unconventional thing would you do?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What was the word?\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Sabbatical.\u00a0 You don\u2019t work for one year.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, sabbatical.\u00a0 I thought \u2014 thought you said \u201csabbath.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a big difference.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost the opposite, when you think about it.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nI think what I\u2019d do is \u2014 look, what I\u2019m doing now is the most exciting job in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s a hard job, not an easy job.\u00a0 It\u2019s a nasty job.\u00a0 It could be a lot easier with \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I think that the \u2014 the news media has to straighten themselves out, because people are getting it.\u00a0 You know, they \u2014 they\u2019re losing tremendous popularity, and they\u2019ve lost their prestige and they\u2019ve lost their credibility.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s a very important thing, the news media, but I think they have to straighten themselves out, because the people are going around them.\n\nNow, they have so many different things with \u2014 like Elon with X, which was a big \u2014 a big thing.\u00a0 And we have Truth, which has been fantastic.\u00a0 And we have so many other things that you don\u2019t really need traditional.\n\nBut I \u2014 I will tell you that there is just nothing I could do to enjoy my life, whether it\u2019s that or anything else that you\u2019d ask, because this is the ultimate.\u00a0 I mean, I had to make a big decision, and it was a very risky decision, because if I would have lost, my life would have been a much different life.\u00a0 It would have been a very nasty life.\u00a0 They were going after me at levels that nobody has ever seen before \u2014 not Andrew Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0\n\nYou know, the historians say that the president that was treated the worst by far by the media and overall was Andrew Jackson.\u00a0 In fact, his wife died of heartbreak.\u00a0 They were treated really rough.\u00a0 And Abraham Lincoln was second, but he had a civil war.\u00a0 You know, you can understand that.\u00a0\n\nBut nobody was treated like me.\u00a0 Nobody.\u00a0 And I will tell you, you learn a lot about yourself.\u00a0 But there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do.\u00a0\n\nI had to make a decision: Do I do this?\u00a0 Because if I lost, it would have been very, very bad.\u00a0 It was dangerous, actually.\u00a0 Very dangerous in so many different ways.\u00a0\n\nAnd I decided to do it.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI have to win, because if I don\u2019t\u201d \u2014 when I spoke to a friend of mine the other night, he said, \u201cYou know, if you lost, it would have been very\u201d \u2014 it was actually Sean Hannity, just before we did the interview last night.\u00a0 He said, \u201cBoy, if you would have lost, it would have \u2014 you would have had a tough life.\u00a0 You would have had a very tough life.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo, it was \u2014 there was a certain amount of courage involved in this decision to run.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a great honor to win by this much \u2014 to win all seven swing states, the popular vote.\u00a0\n\nPopular vote doesn\u2019t get won that much by Republicans, for whatever reason.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s changing, because, again, we\u2019re the party of common sense and they\u2019re the party of some real bad things.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think they\u2019ll change.\u00a0 I think they have to change.\u00a0 It would be wonderful.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be having lunch with some of the Democrats next week, and it would be wonderful if we could work together.\u00a0 I think working together would be great.\u00a0 But they have to change.\u00a0 You can\u2019t get elected on the programs that they want, and that\u2019s one of \u2014 that\u2019s really what America wants to see.\n\nSo, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than what I\u2019m doing right now.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 When we started this conference \u2014 Mr. President, when we started this conference, Yasir and I, His Royal Highness Crown Prince told us, \u201cI want that to be the place where people will come to understand where to invest in terms of geographies and sector.\u201d\u00a0 So, what is the best investment you have made in your personal growth, Mr. President?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I was involved in real estate from, you know, most of my life and was \u2014 you know, guys like Witkoff will tell you I was really good at it and I was successful at it \u2014 very successful at it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been involved in things prior to being president, but during the four years \u2014 during the last four years, you know, I followed sort of the trends, and I\u2019ve made a lot of money with following some of these trends.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 again, it\u2019s something that you do.\u00a0 You \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I really believe that some people have instinct.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve always had an instinct for making money.\u00a0 I make money.\n\nAnd I went into show business.\u00a0 I had one of the most successful shows on television.\u00a0 I wrote books, and they were all bestsellers.\u00a0 Virtually every book a bes- \u2014 was a big bestseller, some really big bestsellers.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s \u2014 whatever I do, I just want to make it successful.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to me.\u00a0\n\nThere are many ways to make money.\u00a0 You can be in many different fields, and a lot of them is being in the right country.\u00a0 You know, if you\u2019re in a certain country \u2014 our country was actually getting very bad \u2014 a very dangerous place, actually.\u00a0 Bad things were happening.\u00a0 But if you\u2019re in a certain country, you have a chance to do well.\u00a0 And no matter how good you are, if you were born into the wrong country, you\u2019re not going to make money.\u00a0\n\nNow, you can do other things.\u00a0 You can attain power, I guess.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s the wrong kind of power, but it\u2019s power.\u00a0 But being in the right country, where you have the right incentives and, you know, entrepreneurship, et cetera.\n\nAnd America has always been sort of at the top \u2014 or one of the top, but always pretty much at the top.\u00a0 But it was losing that \u2014 it was losing that position and, I think, losing it rapidly.\n\nThis last administration \u2014 look, I don\u2019t want to be \u2014 I wish I could say I \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have run if \u2014 if I thought Biden was doing a good job, if I thought they were \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have run, because, as I said, it was very dangerous to run in a lot of ways.\u00a0 In fact, my ear will show that when you look at it closely.\u00a0 My ear \u2014 I have that throbbing feeling every once in a while.\u00a0 But it was dangerous in a lot of different ways.\u00a0 But he was so bad that I had no choice but to do it.\u00a0\n\nIf I thought he was doing a great job, I wouldn\u2019t have run, and I would be very happy.\u00a0 I actually wanted him to do a good job.\u00a0 I was saying, \u201cDo this.\u00a0 Do that.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m telling them do things.\u00a0 They should have done what I said.\u00a0 And \u2014 but I would have been \u2014 I would have been very happy not to have run and, frankly, to have seen somebody do a good job.\u00a0 But our country was going to hell, and I really sort of had to run.\n\nMR. ATTIAS: \u00a0If you were a historical ruler, would you prefer to rule during war or peace?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 I want to be, again, a peacemaker and I want to keep us out of war.\u00a0 But sometimes, to do that, you have to have a very strong country.\u00a0 You have to have a very strong military.\u00a0 And as I said, we have a much stronger military than anyone would know.\u00a0\n\nWe have the best equipment, and I bought a lot of it.\u00a0 I rebuilt our military in the first four years.\u00a0 I rebuilt it.\u00a0 We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, to the Taliban, stupidly \u2014 but that\u2019s a very small amount, relative.\u00a0 It was billions and billions, but it\u2019s still a very small amount relatively to what we built.\u00a0 But I rebuilt \u2014 largely rebuilt our military.\u00a0\n\nNow I\u2019m going to have to do it again, because so much has been given away, so much has been treated so badly.\n\nAnd \u2014 but to keep peace, you really have to \u2014 I have a thing: strength through \u2014 and I mean it, you really have it.\u00a0 You have strength, and you need the strength, but it\u2019s really peace through strength, because without the strength, it\u2019s going to be very hard to have peace because you\u2019re going to be taken over, bad things are going to happen.\u00a0 So, you really want to have peace through strength, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve done it.\n\nHaving strength, having power, in that sense, to protect yourself and your people is a very important thing.\u00a0 Hopefully, you don\u2019t have to use that power.\u00a0\n\nI will tell you, I was dealing with President Putin very successfully on denuclearization.\u00a0 We were talking about it very seriously, and then COVID came and lots of things came.\u00a0 And we had also talked to China about it.\u00a0\n\nNow, Russia and us have the biggest nuclear by far.\u00a0 China is not close, but they will be close.\u00a0 In three or four years or five years, they\u2019ll be equal.\u00a0 But we were going to talk to China, and I spoke to President Xi about it very successfully.\u00a0 I think we were going to denuclearize it.\u00a0 We were \u2014 had to get the smaller nuclear powers, of which there are four \u2014 three, maybe, but four probably \u2014 to do something.\u00a0 We would have been able to do that.\u00a0 But I was having very strong talks with President Putin about denuclearization.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, if you\u2019re president, you get presentations about what we\u2019re building; what we\u2019re having; the power of weapons; the power of many things besides weapons, per se.\u00a0\n\nWhen I saw the power of nuclear weapons \u2014 and we can never let that happen.\u00a0 If that happens, the ball game will be \u2014 the world will be destroyed.\u00a0 The power is so enormous.\u00a0 You look at Hiroshima, you look at Nagasaki \u2014 multiply that times 500 times, and the world would be destroyed.\u00a0\n\nSo, you want somebody as your president or you want somebody as your leader that understands that.\u00a0 We just can\u2019t let that happen.\u00a0\n\nWe can\u2019t let other countries get nuclear weapons \u2014 not only Iran.\u00a0 Iran is a good example, and maybe the one that people think about, but we can\u2019t let that happen.\u00a0\n\nThe power of weaponry today is so enormous that the world \u2014 the world would disintegrate.\u00a0 So, we can\u2019t let it happen.\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Mr. President, if you had to describe United States of America in just three words, what would they be?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 In three words?\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Three words.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Love, respect, and strength.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s a tough question.\u00a0 That might be my best answer, Yasir.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 that reminds me of high school, that one.\u00a0 But that may have been the toughest question, actually.\u00a0\n\nDo you think Joe Biden could have done that?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 We\u2019re almost at the end, Mr. President.\u00a0 But talking about United States of America, what is one cultural habit in the Uni- \u2014 in the U.S. business that the rest of the world could learn from?\u00a0 What is the best practice that (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think we love our families, but I think a lot of the world loves their families, you know?\n\nI was speaking to the head of Mexico, because I complain constantly about people pouring in.\u00a0 Now our border is the strongest border we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gone from the worst border ever in history to the strongest border.\u00a0 But I was speaking to the president of Mexico \u2014 a very wonderful woman, actually \u2014 and I said \u2014 we were talking about drugs \u2014 \u201cYou can\u2019t let people come through your country and come into the country.\u201d\u00a0 You know, I was not that nice, but they understood what I was saying.\u00a0\n\nAnd she said something that really got me.\u00a0 She said \u2014 I said, \u201cAre you a \u2014 you\u2019re not a big drug-taking nation?\u201d\u00a0 And she said, \u201cNo, we are not a consumer.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cA consumer.\u00a0 What a \u2014 you know, an interesting word.\u00a0 \u2018We\u2019re not a consumer nation.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a consumer of drugs.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat an interesting \u2014 and why \u2014 why is that?\u201d\u00a0 He said \u2014 she said, \u201cWell, we have very strong family values.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cBut we do too.\u00a0 We do too.\u201d\u00a0 We have very strong \u2014 our families are devastated by what\u2019s happening with fentanyl.\n\nAnd China will not be doing \u2014 we\u2019re going to make a deal with China.\u00a0 We\u2019re not letting that happen anymore.\u00a0 And I had a deal \u2014 by the way, before I left, I had a deal with President Xi where they were going to give the maximum penalty to anybody making fentanyl and sending it into the United States, and their maximum penalty is the death penalty.\u00a0 And it would have stopped.\u00a0 But when the election turned out to be a rigged election \u2014 but that\u2019s okay \u2014 when election turned out to be \u2014 it was an election that shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0\n\nAll the \u2014 all the things that happened \u2014 I give you an example: We wouldn\u2019t have had October 7th Israel attack.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t have had Ukraine and Russia fighting.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t have had inflation.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t have had all of these things that, you know, happened.\u00a0\n\nBut in speaking with her \u2014 she said about family values \u2014\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not really saying anything there, because we have great families too.\u00a0 We have great family values.\u201d\u00a0 She said, \u201cPlus, we advertise a lot.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cOoh.\u00a0 You mean you advertise about how bad drugs are?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes, we do.\u00a0 We spend a lot of money on advertising.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThat was such a great conversation, because we\u2019re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don\u2019t use them \u2014 that they chew up your brain; they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I thanked her for that.\u00a0 You know, I \u2014 I make so many calls, and I never learn anything from anybody.\u00a0 I know everything, and I never learned anything from anybody.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I spoke to this woman \u2014 as soon as she said it \u2014 she didn\u2019t have to say exactly what \u2014 I said, \u201cExactly.\u00a0 What a great idea.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd I think we\u2019re going to have a \u2014 and I saw pieces of it.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to go in with $100 million and then another $100 million initially.\u00a0 But I saw some of the ads, and they are really violent.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou have to make them strong.\u201d\u00a0 Your skin practically comes off after a period of time.\u00a0 You lose your hearing.\u00a0 You \u2014 you lose your teeth.\u00a0 You lose \u2014 I mean, you \u2014 it \u2014 it is terrible, and we show this happening to people.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think we\u2019re going to \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we did very well with \u2014 we had blue-ribbon committees, headed up by the first lady of the United States and a lot of other people that \u2014 you know, they have no idea the viciousness of these cartels and these people.\u00a0 And they\u2019re smarts.\u00a0 I mean, they\u2019re very smart, tough people \u2014 making a fortune, by the way \u2014 an absolute fortune.\u00a0\n\nBut we got it down 18 percent, which was a record.\u00a0 But 18 percent is not great, when you think about it.\u00a0 I think we could get it down 50 or 55 or maybe even 60 percent with advertising.\u00a0\n\nSo, she really gave me something.\u00a0 I \u2014 I was going to call her and tell her that she did, but now I don\u2019t have to call her because she\u2019s going to be seeing this right now.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nSo, to the president of Mexico: Thank you very much.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 My last question, Mr. President.\u00a0 You have mentioned briefly in your speech about the legacy.\u00a0 What would you like your legacy to be, if you can tell us more about it?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That I came into a country that was great but is in trouble, and I made America great again, and I got it out of trouble.\u00a0 And people respect America now.\u00a0 And we were a country of peace, and we brought peace to the rest of the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nMR. ATTIAS:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6:54 P.M.
