standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section. \u00a0The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget. \u00a0Beginning with the Regulatory Plans, as required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended, or any successor order for fiscal year 2026, and for each fiscal year thereafter:\n\n(a) \u00a0The head of each agency shall identify on an aggregated basis, for regulations that increase incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 3(c) of this order, and provide the agency\u2019s best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.\n\n(b) \u00a0Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. \u00a0Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be added to or removed from the Unified Regulatory Agenda without the approval of the Director. \u00a0To accomplish the purposes of this order, the Director may also require additions to the Unified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan.\n\n(c) \u00a0Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included in the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director.\n\n(d) \u00a0During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2025. \u00a0No regulations exceeding the agency\u2019s total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director. \u00a0The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost.\n\n(e) \u00a0The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Definition. \u00a0For purposes of this order, the term \u201cregulation\u201d or \u201crule\u201d means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, including, without limitation, regulations, rules, memoranda, administrative orders, guidance documents, policy statements, and interagency agreements, regardless of whether the same were enacted through the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act, but does not include:\n\n(a) \u00a0regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States;\n\n(b) \u00a0regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or\n\n(c) \u00a0any other specific regulation or category of regulations exempted by the Director, who shall exempt those regulations or categories of regulations that impose minimal costs or burdens on the private sector or that are requested to be exempted by the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff or the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.\n\nSec. 6. \u00a0Implementation. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Director is charged with implementing this order, including by providing agencies with updated guidance on implementing the ten-for-one rule described in section 3(a) of this order, including processes for identifying regulations for elimination, determining what constitutes, generally and specifically, a \u201crule\u201d or \u201cregulation\u201d for purposes of this order, estimating and standardizing regulatory costs, and ensuring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(b) \u00a0The Director shall revoke OMB Circular No. A-4 of November 9, 2023 (Regulatory Analysis), and all accompanying appendices, guidelines, and documents, and shall reinstate the prior version of Circular A-4, issued on September 17, 2003; and\u00a0\n\n(c)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Treasury and the Director shall reinstate the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget of April\u00a011, 2018, regarding review of tax regulations under Executive Order 12866.\n\nSec. 7.\u00a0 Severability.\u00a0 If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\nSec. 8. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u202f\u00a0\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\u00a0\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\u202f\u00a0\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u202f\u00a0\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\u202f\u00a0\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 31, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On January 31, 2025, an executive order was issued by the President of the United States aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic prosperity. The order outlines a strategy where for every new regulation implemented, at least ten existing ones must be identified for removal. This policy is intended to simplify federal regulations that often impose significant costs and barriers to economic growth and innovation.\n\nTo ensure financial and regulatory prudence, agencies are directed to manage their regulatory budgets by minimizing the incremental costs associated with new regulations. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with providing guidance on measuring regulatory costs, as well as overseeing the implementation and compliance of the regulation cap and incremental cost reduction strategies.\n\nThe order exempts regulations related to national security, military, and immigration functions, among others. The regulatory cap for fiscal year 2025 mandates that the total incremental cost of new and repealed regulations should be significantly less than zero. This is to promote transparency and ensure that regulations are in alignment with executive and legislative priorities.",
