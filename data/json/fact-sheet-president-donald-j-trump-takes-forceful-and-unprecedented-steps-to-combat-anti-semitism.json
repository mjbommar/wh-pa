Trump Takes Forceful and Unprecedented Steps to Combat Anti-Semitism******\n\nJanuary 30, 2025\n\n**COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE UNITED STATES:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n    - Expanding on his Executive Order 13899, President Trump\u2019s new Order takes forceful and unprecedented steps to marshal all Federal resources to combat the explosion of anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our streets since October 7, 2023.\n    - Every Federal executive department and agency leader will review and report to the White House within sixty days on  all  criminal and civil authorities and actions available for fighting anti-Semitism.\n    - Immediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\n    - The Order demands the removal of resident aliens who violate our laws.\n\n**GOING ON OFFENSE TO ENFORCE LAW AND ORDER AND TO PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS:** Immediately after the jihadist terrorist attacks against the people of Israel on October 7, 2023, pro-Hamas aliens and left-wing radicals began a campaign of intimidation, vandalism, and violence on the campuses and streets of America.\n    - Celebrating Hamas\u2019 mass rape, kidnapping, and murder, they physically blocked Jewish Americans from attending college classes, obstructed synagogues and assaulted worshippers, and vandalized American monuments and statues.\n    - The Biden Administration turned a blind eye to this coordinated assault on public order; it simply refused to protect the civil rights of Jewish Americans, especially students. According to a December 2024  U.S. House of Representatives Staff Report  on anti-Semitism, \u201cthe failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding.\u201d\n\n**PRESIDENT TRUMP KEEPS HIS PROMISES AND BUILDS ON HIS SUCCESS:** In his first term, President Trump kept his biggest promises:\n    - He moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem: After decades of broken promises and despite much criticism, President Trump was the President who finally kept his commitment to Israel to move the American embassy from Tel-Aviv to Israel\u2019s true and rightful capital: Jerusalem.\n    - He established the Abraham Accords: President Trump delivered the greatest breakthrough for peace in the Middle East in decades by brokering the normalization of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, protecting Israel and Jews and spreading security and prosperity to the entire region.\n\nNow, President Trump has promised that the Federal Government will:\n    - Protect the civil rights of our Jewish citizens: \u201cMy promise to Jewish Americans is this: With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.\u201d\n    - Aggressively enforce the law, protect public order, and prosecute anti-Semitic crimes: \u201cI will issue clear orders to my Attorney General to aggressively prosecute terroristic threats, arson, vandalism and violence against American Jews.\u201d\n    - Deport Hamas Sympathizers and Revoke Student Visas: \u201cTo all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you. I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.\u201d\n",
  "summary": "**President Donald J. Trump signed a new Executive Order to combat anti-Semitism in the United States on January 30, 2025.** This order builds on the previous Executive Order 13899 and aims to counter the rise in anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses and in various public spaces, which have reportedly increased since October 7, 2023. It mandates all federal departments and agency leaders to assess and report all available legal actions for addressing anti-Semitism within 60 days. Moreover, the Department of Justice is tasked with taking immediate actions to enforce law and order against pro-Hamas activities.\n\n**The order underscores the protection of civil rights for Jewish Americans and promises to enforce laws against anti-Semitic crimes, including deporting non-citizens involved in related activities.** Following the terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, 2023, and subsequent demonstrations on American campuses, President Trump has declared a commitment to aggressively prosecute related criminal activities and cancel visas of pro-Hamas student sympathizers. Additionally, the fact sheet highlights President Trump's past commitments to Israel, such as moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and establishing the Abraham Accords, while focusing on future promises to protect Jewish citizens' rights.",
