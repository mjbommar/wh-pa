EST\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Hello.\u00a0 Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0 I brought some heavy hitters in here with me today.\u00a0Today marks one month of President Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office, and there is no denying this administration is off to a historic start.\u00a0 The President has already signed 73 executive orders.\u00a0 That is more than double the number signed by Joe Biden and more than quadruple the number signed by Barack Obama over the same period.These executive orders have ended burdensome regulations; sealed the border; unleashed our domestic energy sector; eliminated divisive DEI from our federal government; stopped the weaponization of government; cut waste, fraud, and abuse; reinstituted \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade and foreign policies; and ultimately restored common sense.\u00a0The President also signed the Laken Riley Act into law, which ensures ICE will detain illegal aliens arrested or charged with theft or violence.\u00a0As of today, the Senate has already confirmed 18 Cabinet-level nominees, which is more than at this point under the Obama administration in 2009 and more than double the pace of the Biden administration in 2021.\u00a0And today, we expect Kash Patel to be confirmed as the next director of the FBI.\u00a0We are proud to announce that the president will host his first official Cabinet meeting here at the White House next Wednesday, February 26th.\u00a0In just four weeks, President Trump has already hosted the leaders of Israel, Japan, Jordan, and India.\u00a0 And next Monday, the President will host France\u2019s President, Emmanuel Macron, and on Thursday, the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, will visit the White House as well.\u00a0As you all know, over the past month, the President has taken questions from the press \u2014 all of you \u2014 nearly every single day, sometimes on multiple different occasions in the same day, on any topic any of you wish to talk about.\u00a0President Trump set the tone on this approach immediately when he took more than 12 times the questions in his first few hours in office as Joe Biden did in his entire first week.\u00a0Yesterday, we hosted a local media row here at the White House with television and radio stations from across the country that reached up to 60 million viewers and listeners.\u00a0In our ongoing pursuit of transparency, on this one-month celebration, I am thrilled to bring three of my colleagues and our policy experts here at the White House to further recap this incredible first month of accomplishments in greater detail.We have Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller; the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett; and our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz.\u00a0I will hand it over to them.\u00a0 They will deliver brief remarks on the accomplishments of this administration in the first month, and then we will open it up to Q and A.\u00a0 When we open up the Q and A portion, I do ask, for the sake of efficiency in this room, that you direct your question to the principal you seek an answer from.\u00a0 And I will call on you in this room.But first I will let them roll through their remarks.\u00a0 And first up, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen Miller.MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be back.And I want to just thank you all for joining today our one-month celebration of the most historic opening to a presidency in American history.\u00a0 No president comes close to what Donald Trump has achieved over just the last 30 days.He has packed eight years of transformative action restoring this nation, restoring our laws, restoring fairness, restoring economic opportunity, restoring national security in just one month.\u00a0 No one in this country has ever seen anything like it.\u00a0And when you look at the consequentiality and the significance and the transformative nature of the actions he\u2019s taking, it truly defies description.\u00a0 For example, in just one area, this nation has been plagued and crippled by illegal discrimination: diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.\u00a0 It strangled our economy.\u00a0 It has undermined public safety.\u00a0 It has made every aspect of life more difficult, more painful, and less safe.\u00a0He has ended all DEI across the federal government.\u00a0 He has terminated all federal workers involved in promulgating these unlawful policies.\u00a0 He has ended diversity, equity, and inclusion in all federal contracting.\u00a0 He has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy; restored the full, fair, impartial enforcement of our federal civil rights laws for the first time in generations; and he has cracked down on individuals across this government and nonprofits who have engaged in illegal racial discrimination against the American people.\u00a0This includes making clear to every educational institution in this country that ending diversity, equity, and inclusion, ending unlawful race discrimination is a precondition of receiving federal funds.\u00a0He has also saved women\u2019s sports by ending the participation of men in women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 He has ended radical gender ideology across the entire federal government, and he\u2019s pressured the private sector to also end and combat radical gender ideology.\u00a0 He\u2019s reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country \u2014 male and female \u2014 that those are biologically based determinations.\u00a0 They are not based and can never be based on gender identity.\u00a0That includes rooting out of the Department of Defense all DEI policies, all critical race theory, all gender madness, and once again having a military that is focused solely and exclusively on readiness, preparedness, and lethality.As I\u2019m sure Kevin will talk about more, of course, he has undertaken a historic cost-cutting effort across the federal government, launching the first-ever Department of Government Efficiency, uncovering corruption on a scale that we never thought imaginable, terminating every single federal worker that we \u2014 that we have found to be engaged in the corruption and theft and the waste of taxpayer dollars, and already saving $50 billion in a single year, which over a 10-year period would be $500 billion.\u00a0 Just think about how vast and enormous that sum is.\u00a0Of course, as you all know, he has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to its correct and proper name: the Gulf of America.\u00a0 He has renamed Mount Denali into Mount McKinley, part of a historic effort to restore patriotism and national pride all across this land.\u00a0He has ended the weaponization of the federal government, restored the Department of Justice to its true mission of combating threats to this nation and keeping the American people safe.\u00a0He has ended all federal censorship of free speech.\u00a0 This has been one of the greatest crises that has plagued this nation.\u00a0 Years and years and years, the federal government violating the First Amendment to take away Americans\u2019 right of free speech \u2014 President Trump has ended that.\u00a0 And he has demanded that all federal workers, all law enforcement cease any effort to intimidate the rights of Americans or to police their speech.\u00a0He has also restored the death penalty at the Department of Justice, including for illegal aliens who commit murder, including for those who murder cops, and including for all of those who threaten Americans with heinous acts of violence.\u00a0 The death penalty is back.\u00a0 Law and order is back.\u00a0 The streets are being made safe once again.\u00a0On the public health front, he has launched the nation\u2019s first-ever commission \u2014 the MAHA Commission \u2014 Make America Healthy Again, following the historic confirmation of RFK Jr., to finally uncover the true root causes of the public health crisis in this country, the childhood disease epidemic in this country, the spiraling rates of pediatric cancer and devastating childhood sickness.\u00a0He has finally created a situation where the federal heal- \u2014 health agencies in this country will be focused on preventing disease, on keeping children from getting sick in the first place, not sentencing them to a lifetime in and out of hospitals, suffering needlessly, when we can find ways to prevent this epidemic of illness.\u00a0Then, of course, on homeland security.\u00a0 Today, it is officially the law of the land at the conclusion of the congressional notification process that six Mexican cartels and two transnational gangs \u2014 Tren de Aragua, or TDA, and MS-13 \u2014 so eight organizations in total \u2014 are now formally designated as foreign terrorist organizations, which means that every single member of those organizations who operates on U.S. soil is now, as a legal matter, a terrorist, and they will be treated as terrorists.\u00a0This is a sea change in U.S. policy.\u00a0 And this means the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the rest of U.S. law enforcement and the Department of Defense, are now operating in a legal reality where these cartels are recognized as terrorists, and there will be a whole-of-government effort to remove these terrorists from our soil and to degrade their ability to threaten or undermine any American security or sovereignty interests.Border crossings since the day he took office are down 95 percent.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s almost impossible to even describe the scale and scope of that achievement.\u00a0 President Trump, within days of taking office, cut border crossings 95 percent.\u00a0And those few who have dared to cross are being either prosecuted or deported.\u00a0 They\u2019re either facing significant jail time for trafficking, smuggling, harboring, aiding, impeding, or they\u2019re being immediately removed from our soil.\u00a0 Either way, at the end of the process, they are going home.\u00a0He has reimplemented Remain in Mexico, and he has obtained historic cooperation from foreign countries all around the world in accepting their deportees back.\u00a0And he has used the United States military to fully seal the southern border with a historic deployment of both active duty and National Guard troops, resumed the building of infrastructure.\u00a0 He has opened up Guantanamo Bay, and he\u2019s using military aircraft to carry out deportations all across this country.\u00a0And ICE is joining with ATF, DEA, and FBI to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.\u00a0 The criminals are going home.\u00a0 The border is sealed shut.\u00a0 America is safe, sovereign, proud, and free.\u00a0 We are a nation that everyone in the world understands all across this planet: You do not come here illegally.\u00a0 You will not get in.\u00a0 You will go to jail.\u00a0 You will go home.\u00a0 You will not succeed.\u00a0This is the biggest and most successful change in any area of law enforcement that this nation has ever seen, and he did it in under one month.\u00a0Thank you.MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Should I go?MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yes, yes.MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Well, thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 Thank you, Stephen.\u00a0You know, one of the things that President Trump cares most about is job creation.\u00a0 And it was about seven years ago I had the honor of joining you in this room for the first time, and it looks like we\u2019ve created a lot more jobs in the last month.\u00a0 Look at how many people are here.\u00a0 I \u2014 my estimate is about 180 but \u2014 but I didn\u2019t count.\u00a0So, thank you.\u00a0 It\u2019s really an honor to be back here.\u00a0 I think that I just want to go over a few things and then hand it off to Mike.\u00a0The first thing is that the President has told us to prioritize fighting inflation, and he had to do that because, as you know, President Biden let inflation get completely out of control.\u00a0 And he did it with policies that made no sense.\u00a0 They made no sense.\u00a0You know, a lot of times, you people say to us \u2014 our friends, the journalists \u2014 you know, \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d\u00a0 But \u2014 but, you know, I like to think, \u201cWhy did they do that?\u00a0 Why did they spend so much money and then \u2014 why did the Fed print so much money so that we had inflation as high as we\u2019ve ever seen since Jimmy Carter?\u00a0 So, why did they do that?\u201dSo, we\u2019re addressing inflation.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have to address it in the first term, because it was always in the 1s, almost always.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to get it back there.\u00a0And how are we doing it?\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re doing it with a plan that President Trump and I and others have talked about in the Oval that involves, like, every level of fighting inflation.\u00a0First, the macroeconomic level.\u00a0 We\u2019re cutting spending.\u00a0 We\u2019re cutting spending in negotiations with people on the Hill.\u00a0 We\u2019re cutting spending with the advice of our IT consultant, Elon Musk.\u00a0 And then we\u2019re also looking into supply-side things, like restoring Trump\u2019s tax cuts, maybe even expensing new factories so that there is an explosion of supply.\u00a0 If you have an explosion of supply and a reduction in government demand, then inflation goes way down.\u00a0And then, one of the things that you want to say is \u201cWell, when are you going to see it?\u201d\u00a0 Well, the first thing that you\u2019ll see when the markets believe that we\u2019re going to get inflation under control is that the 10-year Treasury rate goes down, because that\u2019s how they think about future expected inflation.\u00a0And so, we\u2019re still going to see some memory of Biden\u2019s inflation.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to go away in a month.\u00a0 But the 10-year Treasury before the last Consumer Price Index had dropped about 40 basis points.\u00a0 Forty basis points because markets were optimistic about our ability to fight inflation.\u00a0Forty basis points is kind of not a fun thing to say.\u00a0 I \u2014 economists talk that way.\u00a0 I apologize.\u00a0 But the way to think about it is, for a typical mortgage, if that affects the mortgage rate, then it\u2019s going to save a typical family buying a house about a thousand bucks a year, and that\u2019s just in our first month.\u00a0Okay.\u00a0 The second thing we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve had a lot of trade talks.\u00a0 In fact, I was just meeting a minister from Mexico with Howard Lutnick just a couple of hours ago.\u00a0 And we\u2019re talking about reciprocal trade, and we\u2019re also talking about the fentanyl crisis.\u00a0And so, reciprocal trade is about our government treating other governments the way they treat us.\u00a0 We want trade to be fair.\u00a0 It turns out that Americans have been disadvantaged by foreign governments over and over, and President Trump wants it to stop.\u00a0 And the fact that struck me as most noticeable, when I started to look at what President Trump was asking us to do, is that last year \u2014 last year \u2014 we have data \u2014 U.S. companies paid $370 billion in taxes to foreign governments \u2014 $370 billion.\u00a0 Last year, foreign multinationals paid us $57 billion in taxes.\u00a0We have one quarter of world GDP.\u00a0 They have three quarters of world GDP.\u00a0 And we\u2019re paying $370.\u00a0 They\u2019re paying $57.\u00a0 This is not reciprocal.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to try \u2014 or we\u2019re going to fix it.\u00a0The other thing that we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve had an all-of-the-above energy approach that\u2019s led by Doug Burgum and Chris and a really large team \u2014 EPA \u2014 and we\u2019ve already made so many actions that are going to affect the price of energy and lower inflation.\u00a0We\u2019ve opened up 625 million acres to energy exploration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve cut 50 years of red tape that makes it so you can\u2019t have permits.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve even made it so that when you go home, if you get a new one, then you can take a shower or flush a toilet or read under a light bulb.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing that too.\u00a0So \u2014 so, finally, let\u2019s just think about, like, the facts that we can see right now that we think are awesome.\u00a0 So, guess what?\u00a0 Small-business optimism is \u2014 has go- \u2014 gone up by the most ever since President Trump came in.\u00a0 ISM, which is the measure of what\u2019s going on in manufacturing, it\u2019s expanding again for the first time in years.\u00a0 CEO confidence is the highest it\u2019s been in years.\u00a0 And the reason \u2014 the reason people are thinking this is that our policies give people cause for optimism.\u00a0And then I want to reiterate what Stephen Miller said, because it\u2019s so important \u2014 and it\u2019s so important for financial markets to start to digest this \u2014 that if, say, the Treasury secretary or the \u2014 any Cabinet secretary, with Elon Musk, is able to find some savings \u2014 say, $100 billion \u2014 well, in CBO land, that\u2019s actually, like, about 10 times that or maybe 12 times that over a 10-year window.\u00a0And so, when you\u2019re thinking about the negotiations right now over reconciliation and thinking about, well, $4 trillion, $5 trillion, well, those numbers, in terms of the savings, are going to end up being small because of all the waste that we\u2019re finding.\u00a0And so, we\u2019re incredibly optimistic about the future of inflation and the future of our economy.\u00a0 And we\u2019re optimistic because we\u2019re making so much progress so far, and we already see it in market prices.\u00a0And, with that, I\u2019ll hand it off to Mike.\u00a0MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thanks, Kevin.\u00a0Well, good afternoon.\u00a0 What a month and what a sea change in our \u2014 in our foreign policy.\u00a0 In addition to what we\u2019re doing on the border and restoring American sovereignty, in addition to what we\u2019re doing in our economy and the job creation and the inflation reduction, we are bringing the world back to where it was at the end of President Trump\u2019s first term, which is a world of peace, prosperity, and \u2014 and looking forward and getting us out of the chaos that we\u2019ve just seen over the last four years.\u00a0So, over the last month, just to name a few, I had the honor of sitting in the Oval Office as President Trump spoke with President Putin and then immediately spoke with President Zelenskyy, and both of them said only President Trump could bring both sides to the table, and only President Trump could stop the horrific fighting that has been going on now for the better part of four years and that only President Trump could drive the world back to peace.\u00a0 Both of those leaders said that in back-to-back calls.And, of course, we just had our historic talks mediated by our \u2014 our good friends and partners, Saudi Arabia \u2014 we give great thanks to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for hosting \u2014 and sat down for the first time in years with the Russians and talked about a path forward with peace.On top of that and one of the things that led to that was a tremendous co- \u2014 confidence-building measure that we had with the release of Marc Fogel.\u00a0 I\u2019ll remind everyone, the last time that we had an American released from the Russians, either we gave up a deadly spy; pressured our allies to give up a lethal killer; or we released, under the Biden administration, the world\u2019s most notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who, by the way, had one of his main clients for arms the cartels in \u2014 in Mexico and Central America.\u00a0We gave up none of that.\u00a0 This was released as a confidence-building measure, working with our great Middle East Envoy, Steve Witkoff, and our secretary of State as a first step towards opening these talks and then moving forward towards peace.\u00a0On top of that, we\u2019ve secured, just in a month, the return of a dozen \u2014 12 \u2014 American hostages from Russia, from Bulgaria, from Venezuela, the Taliban, and Hamas.\u00a0 Excuse me, that\u2019s from Belarus, not Bulgaria.\u00a0We also had \u2014 for the first time in quite some time, we took out a senior leader of ISIS, an international financier and recruiter that the military had been trying to take out for quite some time and \u2014 and wasn\u2019t able to do so, frankly, because of a bureaucratic approval process.\u00a0 President Trump said, \u201cTake him out.\u201d\u00a0 And that ISIS financier and leader is no longer on this Earth.\u00a0We\u2019ve also taken action to eliminate other terrorist organizations in the Middle East.\u00a0 We drove \u2014 before the President was even in office, he started talking consequences for people that would hold Americans.\u00a0Heretofore, there\u2019s been nothing but upside.\u00a0 You take an American, you get some better deal.\u00a0 You take another one, maybe you get a better deal.\u00a0 No more.\u00a0 There is now nothing but downside for taking Americans illegally, either as hostages or illegal detainees.\u00a0And when President Trump sent a very clear message across the Middle East, but particularly to Hamas, that there would be all hell to pay, we suddenly saw a breakthrough.\u00a0 And now we just saw the release of yet another group of hostages.\u00a0 There have been dozens now, including two Americans that we\u2019ve seen once again reunited with their families.\u00a0As part of the talks with King Abdullah, he offered \u2014 and \u2014 and I think the entire world has graciously accepted \u2014 to take 2,000 sick children, cancer patients, and others out of Gaza.\u00a0 As a humanitarian \u2014 as a humanitarian gesture, 2,000 Gazans will come out of that hellhole that it is, that wasteland that Gaza is right now, with unexploded ordnance, with debris everywhere, with no sewage, with no water.\u00a0 And \u2014 and President Trump has \u2014 has put forward a plan to deal with the practical reality that is 1.8 million Gazans now \u2014 now truly suffering.And then, you know, just to bring it back to our own hemisphere, we\u2019ve seen literally, in the last month \u2014 after years of national security experts, the generals in charge, and others testifying and ringing the alarm bells about \u2014 about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s presence in our own hemisphere, particularly in the Panama Canal, we\u2019re seeing the leadership of Panama step away from the Belt and Road program, move away from China and back towards the United States, and even enter into talks and \u2014 and other negotiations about addressing the ports on either side of the canal.\u00a0And then, finally, last but not least, we\u2019ve had four world leaders in the White House, in the Oval Office.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had the prime minister of Japan, the prime minister of India, the king of \u2014 of Jordan, and, of course, the prime minister of Israel just in the last four weeks.\u00a0 And next week, we\u2019ll have the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and we\u2019ll have the president of France, Macron.\u00a0So, President Trump is on what we call Trump warp speed.\u00a0 We are all \u2014 we are all honored to be really serving under \u2014 under his leadership and his vision.\u00a0 And truly, you know, when we all say \u2014 and the President himself say \u2014 says, he is a president of peace.\u00a0 He is a president focused on restoring stability.\u00a0 I think the entire world saw what the world would look like without strong American leadership in the last four years.And it\u2019s truly been an honor to get us back to where we were and back on track under President Trump\u2019s leadership.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you, Mike.\u00a0MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very eager to ask questions of these very smart people working very hard on behalf of the president.\u00a0We do have somebody in our new media seat today.\u00a0 We have John Stoll, who is the head of news at X.\u00a0 As you all know \u2014 you\u2019re all on X \u2014 it\u2019s home to hundreds of millions of users, a large contingent of independent journalists and news organizations across geographies and political spectrums.\u00a0 And at the same time, X remains the go-to platform for many legacy news outlets.\u00a0 And I know, as I mentioned, many of the reporters in this room use X to attract eyeballs to your work.\u00a0Prior to joining X, John spent two decades in journalism, including several years as an editor at The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 We are excited to have him in the briefing room today.John, we\u2019ll let you kick it off.\u00a0 And as I said at the top, please direct your question to the individual up here who you\u2019d like an answer from.\u00a0John, why don\u2019t you begin.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I am sitting in for a thriving ecosystem of journalists, independent and \u2014 and emerging news organizations who do depend on X for publicity, for a business model.\u00a0 And so, I look forward to seeing many of them in this seat in months and years to come.\u00a0I also thank you, Karoline, for opening this seat up to new media.\u00a0 It \u2014 it really is a testament not only to your open-mindedness but also to innovation that you\u2019d actually think about, you know, folks that are not traditionally credentialed to be in this room to be in this room and to not only have a question but also to witness \u2014 you know, this is at a very important intersection of power and the free press.And so, just the ability to witness this and \u2014 and be part of it, it brings everybody\u2019s game up.\u00a0 So, thank you for that.\u00a0I think this is for Mike Waltz.\u00a0 My question is about Ukraine.MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Sure.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For about more than 10 years, I\u2019ve been fascinated, like all \u2014 like many, with what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 I was in Northern Europe working out of the Baltics when Crimea was annexed and was \u2014 a lot \u2014 a lot of this came on Twitter.\u00a0 The platform used to be known as Twitter.\u00a0 Was \u2014 a lot of European leaders would \u2014 would talk about their disappointment and \u2014 and solidarity with Ukraine, but when it came to actually doing something, it felt like they were passing a hot potato and sent it over the Atlantic.\u00a0I wonder how much of what we\u2019re seeing right now out of the administration and President Trump is a call to Europe and the European leaders and allies that we\u2019ve traditionally had to pick up that hot potato and \u2014 and start doing something a little bit more concrete to win and preserve the peace in Ukraine.\u00a0The second question I have is \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s related \u2014 is there\u2019s been some \u2014 a lot of speculation that President Trump and the administration might be manipulated by Pre- \u2014 by Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about the administration\u2019s posture \u2014MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Yeah.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and your confidence in the competence of this administration to d- \u2014 go toe to toe with Vladimir Putin.\u00a0MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Well, if there\u2019s an- \u2014 I\u2019ll take the l- \u2014 second question first.\u00a0 If there\u2019s anybody in this world that can go toe to toe with Putin, that could go toe to toe with Xi, that could go toe to toe with Kim Jong Un \u2014 and we could keep going down the list \u2014 it\u2019s Donald J. Trump.\u00a0 He is the dealmaker in chief.\u00a0 There is no question that he is the commander in chief.\u00a0And I, for one \u2014 and I think all Americans and around the world should have no doubt about his ability to not only handle Putin but to handle the complexity of driving this war to an end.\u00a0And then on your first piece on Europe, I\u2019ll take you back to 2014.\u00a0 You\u2019re right.\u00a0 There was a lot of hand-wringing in Europe and not a lot of action.\u00a0 There was also a lot of hand-wringing here in Washington under the Obama administration and not a lot of action.\u00a0 They literally threw blankets at the problem.\u00a0And so, I\u2019ll remind everyone that Putin had, you know, some type of conflict, invasion, or issue with their neighbor under President Bush, with Georgia; under President Obama, with Ukraine in 2014; not under President Trump, 45; and again with President Biden in 2022.\u00a0 The war should have been deterred.\u00a0 The war should have never happened, and I have no doubt it would not have happened under President Trump and will stop under President \u2014 President Trump again.\u00a0But I just want to push back on this notion of our European allies not being consulted as we\u2019ve entered into this process.\u00a0 I already mentioned the immediate phone call President Trump made to President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 He has talked to President Macron of France repeatedly last week.\u00a0 President Macron convened European leaders and then is coming here on Monday.\u00a0 Prime Minister Starmer is coming next Thursday.\u00a0We\u2019ve also \u2014 I\u2019ve talked to every one of my national security \u2014 national security advisor counterparts across \u2014 across the spectrum in Europe.\u00a0 I\u2019ve talked to Secretary-General Rutte, the \u2014 the leader of NATO, the secretary-general of NATO.\u00a0 We have repeatedly \u2014 oh, by the way, we had half our Cabinet \u2014 seven Cabinet officials, including the vice president, at the Munich Security Conference, all engaging, all listening, and all making sure our allies were heard.\u00a0However, we\u2019ve also made it clear for years \u2014 decades, even \u2014 that it is unacceptable that the United States and the United States taxpayer continues to bear the burden not only of the cost of the war in Ukraine but of the defense of \u2014 of Europe.\u00a0 We fully support our NATO Allies.\u00a0 We fully support the Article 5 commitment.\u00a0 But it\u2019s time for our European allies to step up.\u00a0And one of the things that Secretary-General Rutte said on our call was this last couple of weeks have been a real wake-up call.\u00a0 And I asked him, \u201cWhat have you been missing the last couple of years?\u201d\u00a0The fact that we are going to enter into a NATO summit this June with a third of our NATO Allies still not meeting the 2 percent minimum, a commitment they made a decade ago \u2014 literally a decade ago \u2014 with a war on their doorstep \u2014 the largest war that they\u2019re all extremely concerned about \u2014 but yet it\u2019s \u201cWell, somebody else needs to pay.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got other domestic priorities.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s unacceptable.\u00a0 President Trump has made that clear.\u00a0And the minimum needs to be met.\u00a0 We need to be at 100 percent in \u2014 this June at the NATO summit.\u00a0 And then let\u2019s talk about exceeding it, which what \u2014 is what President Trump has been talking about, with 5 percent of GDP.\u00a0Europe needs to step up for their own defense as a partner.\u00a0 And we can be friends and allies and have those tough conversations.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Peter.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 I have a Ukraine one and a DOGE one.\u00a0 Who can talk DOGE?MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Stephen, go ahead.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, so \u2014 so, Stephen, we\u2019re hearing about these DOGE dividend checks that would be 20 percent back to taxpayers, 20 percent to pay down the debt.\u00a0 Sixty percent is left.\u00a0 Who gets that?MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Well, the way that it works is when you achieve savings, you can either return it to taxpayers, you can return it to our debtors, or it can be cycled into next year\u2019s budget, and then it just lowers the overall baseline for next year.\u00a0 So, in other words, you can just transfer it into the next fiscal window and then lower the overall spending level.\u00a0 And that means that you can achieve a permanent savings that way, and that reduces the deficit.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when is it that people might see those checks?MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Well, this is all going to be worked on through the reconciliation process with Congress that\u2019s going underway right now, as you\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 The Senate is moving a bill.\u00a0 The House is moving a bill.\u00a0 The president has great confidence in both chambers to deliver on his priorities.\u00a0I would just take this opportunity to note that President Trump has made a historic commitment to the working class of this country to fight for a major tax relief and major price relief.\u00a0 And cutting spending, as DOGE is doing, and cutting taxes is the key to delivering on both of those promises.\u00a0 And President Trump is resolutely committed to doing both.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And on Ukraine.\u00a0 I guess, this is for Mike.MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the president\u2019s post on Truth Social yesterday, need to know: Who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin or Zelenskyy?MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Well, look, his \u2014 his goal, Peter, is to bring this war to an end, period.\u00a0 And there has been ongoing fighting on both sides.\u00a0 It is World War I-style trench warfare.\u00a0His frustration with President Zelenskyy is \u2014 that you\u2019ve heard \u2014 is multifold.\u00a0 One, there needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in \u2014 in his first term, and what we\u2019ve done since.\u00a0 So, some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and \u2014 and insults to President Trump were unacceptable.\u00a0 Number one.\u00a0Number two, our own secretary of Treasury personally made the trip to offer the Ukrainians what is \u2014 can only be described as a historic opportunity \u2014 that is for America to coinvest with Ukraine in their minerals, in their resources, to truly grow the pie.\u00a0So, case in point, there\u2019s a foundry that processes aluminum in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been damaged.\u00a0 It\u2019s not at its current capacity.\u00a0 If that is restored, it would account for America\u2019s entire imports of aluminum for an entire year \u2014 that one foundry.There are tremendous resources there.\u00a0 Not only is that long-term security for Ukraine, not only do we help them grow the pie with investments, but, you know, we do have an obligation to the American taxpayer in helping them recoup the hundreds of billions that ha- \u2014 that have occurred.\u00a0So, you know, rather than enter \u2014 enter into some constructive conversations about what that deal should be going forward, we got a lot of rhetoric in the media that was \u2014 that was incredibly unfortunate.\u00a0And I could just tell you, Peter, you know, as a veteran, as somebody who\u2019s been in combat, this war is horrific.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve lost sight of that, of the literally thousands of people that are dying a day, families that are going without the next generation.\u00a0And I find it kind of, you know, frankly, ridiculous.\u00a0 So many people in Washington that were just demanding, pounding the table for a ceasefire in Gaza are suddenly aghast that the president would demand one and both sides come to the table when it talks to \u2014 when it comes to Ukraine, a war that has been arguably far greater in \u2014 in scope and scale and far more dangerous in terms of global escalation to U.S. security.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I do have one for Karoline.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does President Trump have a bet with Trudeau about this USA-Canada hockey game tonight?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And when there is a big hockey game on, is the president watching for the goals or for the fights?MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Probably both.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s watching for the United States to win tonight.\u00a0 I know he talked to the USA hockey team this morning.\u00a0 He talked to the players after their morning practice, around 10 o\u2019clock.\u00a0 And I also spoke to some folks from that team after.\u00a0 They were jubilant over President Trump\u2019s comments to the team.\u00a0 I believe they\u2019re going to put out a video of that call.\u00a0So, he looks forward to watching the game tonight, and we look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state, Canada.\u00a0 (Laughter.)Bloomberg, go ahead.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My question is for Mike Waltz.\u00a0 Can you give us a readout of Kellogg\u2019s meeting with Zelenskyy that just wrapped up?\u00a0 And, in particular, Zelenskyy publicly rejected this deal about the rare earth minerals.\u00a0 Where \u2014 where does that stand?MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to continue to have \u2014 he needs to come back to the table, and we\u2019re going to continue to have discussions about where that deal is going.\u00a0Again, we have an obligation to the taxpayer.\u00a0 I think this is an opportunity.\u00a0 The president thinks this is an opportunity for Ukraine going forward.\u00a0 There can be, in my view, nothing better for Ukraine\u2019s future and for their security than \u2014 than to have the United States invested in their prosperity long-term.\u00a0 And then a key piece of this has also been security guarantees.\u00a0Look, the \u2014 the reality that we\u2019re talking about here is: Is it in Ukraine\u2019s interest?\u00a0 Is it in Europe\u2019s interest?\u00a0 It certainly isn\u2019t in Russia\u2019s interest or in the American people\u2019s interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever.\u00a0So, a key part of his conversation was helping President Zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end.\u00a0 This kind of open-ended mantra that we\u2019ve had under the Biden administration, that\u2019s over.\u00a0 And I think a lot of people are having a hard time accepting that.And then the other piece is there\u2019s been discussions from Prime Minister Starmer and also President Macron about European-led security guarantees.\u00a0 We welcome that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been asking Europe to step up and secure its own prosperity, safety, and security.\u00a0 So, we certainly welcome that.\u00a0And we certainly welcome more European assistance.\u00a0 As I told my counterparts, \u201cCome to the table with more, if \u2014 if you want a bigger seat at the table.\u201d\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been asking for that for quite some time.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And has Russia pushed for sanctions in your talks with them?\u00a0 And have you consulted with international partners and allies about potentially rolling back sanctions in these negotiations to end the war?MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Those \u2014 the talks with \u2014 with our Russian counterparts \u2014 both with my counterpart, the national security advisor; Secretary Rubio\u2019s counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lavrov \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it really were \u2014 was quite broad, focused on what is the goals for our broader relationship, but very clear that the fighting has to stop to get to any of those brighter goals.\u00a0And as a first step, we\u2019re just going to do some commonsense things, like restore the \u2014 the ability of both of our embassies to function.\u00a0And, again, you know, this is \u2014 this was common sense.\u00a0 In \u2014 in foreign policy world, they call it \u201cshuttle diplomacy.\u201d\u00a0 We have to talk to both sides in order to get to both sides to the table, and both sides have said only President Trump could do that.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Diana.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And my question is for Mike Waltz.\u00a0 (Laughter.)MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 All right.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The president has called Zelenskyy a dictator.\u00a0 Does he view Putin as a dictator?\u00a0And does he want Zelenskyy out of power?\u00a0 I know he\u2019s called for elections.\u00a0And then, thirdly, the head of the Defense Committee in Ukraine\u2019s parliament just has claimed that the U.S. has stopped selling weapons to Ukraine.\u00a0 Is that true?MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Well, most of our weapons that have gone to Ukraine have been part of a drawdown authority, where we\u2019ve literally taken them out of our stocks and then, eventually, through appropriations, started buying them again to refill our stocks.\u00a0I\u2019ll, you know, just state that there has been a lag in a lot of that process.\u00a0 So, many of our stocks, as we look at our operations around the world, are becoming more depleted.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the reasons many people have had a lot of concern about: When does this end?\u00a0 How much is it going to take?\u00a0 How many lives will be lost?\u00a0 How much will we be \u2014 how much will we spend?\u00a0As a member of Congress, we repeatedly asked the Biden administration those questions, and we never got a satisfactory answer.\u00a0Look, President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy \u2014 the fact that \u2014 that he hasn\u2019t come to the table, that he hasn\u2019t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered.\u00a0 I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.But President Trump is \u2014 as we made clear to our Russian counterparts, and I want to make clear today \u2014 he\u2019s focused on stopping the fighting and moving forward.\u00a0 And we could argue all day long about what\u2019s happened in the past.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Reagan.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 I have a question for Stephen \u2014(Cross-talk.)Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and a question for Mike.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Excuse me, I just called on Reagan.\u00a0 Reagan, go ahead.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have a question for Stephen and a question for Mike.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stephen, I can start with you.\u00a0 There have been reports \u2014MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Thank you.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that Trump is unhappy with the rate of deportations and he wants them to be higher.\u00a0 Is the president happy with the rate of deportations, and are there any plans to speed up the process?MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Well, first of all, we all appreciate the encouragement from the media to deport as many illegal aliens as humanly possible.\u00a0 So, thank you.\u00a0And I will promise you that the full might of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and every element and instrument of national power will be used to remove, with speed, all criminal illegals from the soil of the United States of America, to enforce final removal orders, and to ensure that this country is for American citizens and those who legally belong in this country.We inherited an ICE that was completely shuttered.\u00a0 We inherited a Department of Homeland Security whose sole mission was to resettle illegal aliens within the United States of America.\u00a0In 30 days, the president sealed the border shut, declared the cartels to be terrorist organizations, has increased ICE deportations to levels not seen in decades, and we are shortly on the verge of achieving a pace and speed of deportations this country has never before seen.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Mike.MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There have been reports that there\u2019s some underground opposition to Trump\u2019s pick for Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, Elbridge Colby.\u00a0 Have you or anyone from the administration been personally lobbying senators to support Elbridge Colby?\u00a0MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Look, I\u2019ve worked with Bridge Co- \u2014 Colby in the past.\u00a0 He has the president\u2019s full support to be the Undersecretary of policy, which will be a critical policy arm for Secretary Hegseth going forward that will implement a lot of these policies.\u00a0And \u2014 and really, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s been the extent of it.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s been a lot of kind of, you know, breathless \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 back-and-forth in the \u2014 in the press, but we\u2019re full speed ahead to get the president\u2019s team in place so we can implement his America First policy.\u00a0MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Mike has spoken pretty extensively.\u00a0 Does anybody have questions for Stephen or for Mr. Hassett?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I do.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Nobody wants to talk about the economy?\u00a0 (Laughter.)(Cross-talk.)MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IRS.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 IRS.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Go ahead.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And this would be for either one of you.\u00a0 So, we have reported, several other outlets have reported that about 3,500 people are due to be \u2014 lose their jobs at the IRS by the end of the week.\u00a0 If the goal of these spending cuts across the federal government has been to reduce the debt, why impose some of the deepest cuts we\u2019ve seen so far at the agency responsible for raising revenue for the federal government?MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Well, I think our objective is to make sure that the employees that we pay are being productive and effective.\u00a0 And there are many, many \u2014 more than 100,000 people working to collect taxes, and not all of them are fully occupied.\u00a0 And the Treasury secretary is studying the matter and feels like 3,500 is a small number and probably can get bigger, especially as we improve the IT at the IRS.And so \u2014 so, I think that it\u2019s absolutely something that is on the table for good reasons.\u00a0 And the point is that \u2014 don\u2019t just talk about the IRS.\u00a0 Talk about all of government, that there are so many places \u2014 I live in D.C.; you maybe live in D.C. \u2014 where you never \u2014 there \u2014 nobody \u2014 nobody is going into the buildings.\u00a0 People aren\u2019t commuting because nobody is doing their job.\u00a0 We look back and we see that there are all these people doing two jobs while they\u2019re getting a government payroll \u2014 on the payroll.\u00a0So, the point is, we\u2019re fixing that, and the IRS is a small part of that picture.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you\u2019re saying that everybody who\u2019s being let go was doing a bad job?MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 I\u2019m saying that we\u2019re studying every agency and deciding who to let go and why, and we\u2019re doing so very rationally with a lot of support from analysis.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because we\u2019re being told by a lot of people who have been let go at other agencies that they were told they were being dismissed because of poor performance, when, in some cases, they haven\u2019t even had a performance review yet because they\u2019ve only been on the job a couple of months.\u00a0MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019ve never seen a person who was laid off for poor performance say that they were performing poorly.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Good point.\u00a0 Sure, Kaitlan.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have a question.\u00a0 I\u2019ll start with you, Kevin Hassett.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 And then I\u2019ve got a question for Mr. Waltz.On these potential checks that you might send out from DOGE, is there a concern, as you\u2019re thinking through this, that they could be inflationary?MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Oh, absolutely not, because imagine if we don\u2019t spend government money and we give it back to people, then the \u2014 you know, if they spend it all, then you\u2019re even.\u00a0 But they\u2019re probably going to save a lot of it, in which case, you\u2019re reducing inflation.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So, you\u2019re not \u2014MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 And also, when the government spends a lot, that\u2019s what creates inflation.\u00a0 We learned that from Joe Biden.\u00a0 And so, if we reduce government spending, then that\u2019s \u2014 you know, reduces inflation.\u00a0 And if you give people money, then they\u2019re going to save a bunch of it.\u00a0 And \u2014 and when they save it, then that also reduces demand and reduces inflation.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So, you\u2019re not worried about it.\u00a0MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 No, I\u2019m not.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, Mr. Waltz, to follow up on Peter\u2019s question, you wrote in an op-ed in the fall of 2023 that, quote, \u201cPutin is to blame, certainly, like al Qaeda was to blame for 9/11.\u201dMR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you still feel that way now, or do you share the president\u2019s assessment, as he says Ukraine is to blame for the start of this war?MR. WALTZ:\u00a0 Well, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that I share the president\u2019s assessment on all kinds of issues.\u00a0 What I wrote as a Member of Congress is \u2014 was as a former Member of Congress.\u00a0Look, what I share the president\u2019s assessment on is that the war has to end.\u00a0 And what comes with that?\u00a0 What comes with that should be, at some point, elections.\u00a0 What comes with that should be peace.\u00a0 What comes with that is prosperity that we\u2019ve just offered in this natural resources and economic partnership arrangement: an end to the killing and European security and security for the world.\u00a0 The President is not only determined to do that in Europe, he\u2019s determined to do it in the Middle East.\u00a0And just a few months ago, we had an administration that had tried for 15 months, week after week, sitting with you here, and couldn\u2019t get us to a ceasefire, couldn\u2019t get our hostages out.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re at that point.\u00a0 We\u2019re back to the maximum pressure on Iran.And we will \u2014 we have just begun, and we will drive towards a ceasefire and all of those other steps.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to pre-negotiate or get ahead of the sequencing of all of that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very delicate situation.\u00a0But this is a president of peace.\u00a0 And who here would argue against peace?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So, you do share that assessment.\u00a0And can I follow up.\u00a0 In 2017 \u2014MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Go ahead, Jordan.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 then-President Trump \u2014MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Go ahead, Jordan.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I just follow up really quickly?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 So \u2014MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 You just had two questions, Kaitlan.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 May I \u2014 can I just \u2014MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Jordan, go ahead.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. \u2014 Mr. Hassett \u2014MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have an important follow-up for Mike Waltz.MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Jordan, go ahead.\u00a0 Go ahead.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, Mr. Hassett, you were speaking about tariff revenue, and you also addressed a question about the R- \u2014 IRS.\u00a0 President Trump has spoken about replacing income tax with tariff revenue, especially with all this waste, fraud, and abuse that we\u2019re seeing cut.\u00a0 Is that a possibility?MR. HASSETT:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 And, in fact, if you think about the China tariff revenue that we\u2019re estimating is coming in from the 10 percent that we just added, plus the de minimis thing, that it\u2019s between $500 billion and a trillion dollars over 10 years, is our estimate.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something that is outside of the reductions that markets are seeing through the negotiations up on the Hill.And so, we expect that the tariff revenue is actually going to make it much easier for Republicans to pass a bill, and that was the President\u2019s plan all along.\u00a0Thank you.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I \u2014 I have a question for Stephen Miller about DOGE.\u00a0 So, you \u2014 you spoke about DOGE.\u00a0 You said roughly $50 billion is set to be cut in a year of waste, fraud, and abuse by unelected bureaucrats.\u00a0 We\u2019re hearing this ironic narrative from the President\u2019s critics and the left-wing media that Elon Musk is an unelected bureaucrat, and he\u2019s doing all this terrible stuff.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t one of DOGE\u2019s objectives to get \u2014 get rid of the federal bureaucracy, the \u2014 the deep state?\u00a0 And also, who was running the White House when Joe Biden was in office \u2014MR. MILLER:\u00a0 (Laughs.)Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 because I don\u2019t know a single person who believes it was Joe Biden?\u00a0MR. MILLER:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 You\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re tempting me to say \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 some very harsh things about some of our media friends.\u00a0 The \u2014 yes, it is true that many of the people in this room, for four years, failed to cover the fact that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent and was not running the country.\u00a0It is also true that many people in this room who have used this talking point that Elon is not elected fail to understand how government works.\u00a0 So, I\u2019m glad for the opportunity for a brief civics lesson.\u00a0A president is elected by the whole American people.\u00a0 He\u2019s the only official in the entire government that is elected by the entire nation.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Judges are appointed.\u00a0 Members of Congress are elected at the district or state level.\u00a0 Just one man.\u00a0And the Constitution, Article Two, has a clause, known as the vesting clause, and it says, \u201cThe executive power shall be vested in a president,\u201d singular.\u00a0 The whole will of democracy is imbued into the elected president.\u00a0 That president then appoints staff to then impose that democratic will onto the government.\u00a0The threat to democracy \u2014 indeed, the existential threat to democracy \u2014 is the unelected bureaucracy of lifetime, tenured civil servants who believe they answer to no one, who believe they can do whatever they want without consequence, who believe they can set their own agenda no matter what Americans vote for.\u00a0So, Americans vote for radical FBI reform, and FBI agents say they don\u2019t want to change.\u00a0 Or Americans vote for radical reform in our energy policies, but EPA bureaucrats say they don\u2019t want to change.\u00a0 Or Americans vote to end DEI \u2014 racist DEI policies, and lawyers in the Department of Justice say they don\u2019t want to change.\u00a0What President Trump is doing is he is removing federal bureaucrats who are defying democracy by failing to implement his lawful orders, which are the will of the whole American people.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Stephen.\u00a0 Can I follow up?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline.MS.

  "summary": "On February 20, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, along with other key administration figures, delivered a press briefing to highlight key achievements in President Trump's second term. The briefing reviewed accomplishments including the signing of 73 executive orders meant to reduce regulations, revitalize energy policies, and reinforce national security through measures such as sealing the border and renaming significant landmarks. Prominent attendees included Stephen Miller, Kevin Hassett, and Mike Waltz, who emphasized actions taken across policy areas like border security, economic reforms, and international relations.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller highlighted the administration's drastic reduction in illegal immigration and the reclassification of certain foreign groups as terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett focused on economic strategies to combat inflation by reducing government spending and increasing trade reciprocity. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz discussed diplomatic efforts aimed at negotiating peace in global conflicts, notably between Russia and Ukraine, while reasserting alliances with world leaders. The session also addressed plans for a newly formed government efficiency department to tackle waste and enhance productivity in federal agencies, drawing in stakeholders like Elon Musk for consultation on technological improvements.",
