and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability.\u00a0Sec. 3. \u00a0Implementation. \u00a0Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield. \u00a0The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for:\u00a0(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries;\u00a0(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer;\u00a0\u00a0(iii) \u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept;\u00a0\u00a0(iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack;\u00a0(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture;\u00a0\u00a0(vi) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase;\u00a0(vii)\u00a0 \u00a0Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features; and(viii) \u00a0Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of Defense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to implement this directive;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) \u00a0In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United States Northern Command, submit to the President:\u00a0(i) \u00a0\u00a0An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and(ii) \u00a0A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries.\u00a0\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review. \u00a0The United States continues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops. \u00a0Following the submission to the President of the next-generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States troops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners.\n\nSec. 5.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n    - the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n    - the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 27, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On January 27, 2025, a Presidential Action titled 'The Iron Dome for America' was announced, highlighting the strategic importance of a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States. The directive outlines the continued threat of advanced aerial attacks, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles, and emphasizes the need for effective defense mechanisms against these evolving threats. It draws parallels to former President Ronald Reagan's initiatives and notes the intensifying advancements in strategic weapons by adversaries, advocating for a proactive policy to ensure national security.\n\nThe document mandates that within 60 days, the Secretary of Defense must submit a comprehensive plan, referencing architecture and requirements for the missile defense system. This includes defense against a wide array of missile threats and the development of space-based interceptors and other strategic capabilities. The plan must include funding strategies, cooperative defense efforts with allies, and updated threat assessments. This initiative underscores a robust national defense policy aiming to strengthen missile defense capabilities and international collaborations.\n\nAdditionally, the directive seeks to enhance U.S. allied defense relationships by directing reviews of theater missile defenses and increasing cooperation with partners on missile defense technologies and operations. The policy underscores a commitment to maintaining peace through strength and the nation's ability to deter and defend against any aerial threat to its sovereignty.",
