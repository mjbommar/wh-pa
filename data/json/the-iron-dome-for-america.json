and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0The United States will guarantee its secure second-strike capability.\u00a0Sec. 3. \u00a0Implementation. \u00a0Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Submit to the President a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield. \u00a0The architecture shall include, at a minimum, plans for:\u00a0(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defense of the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries;\u00a0(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acceleration of the deployment of the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor layer;\u00a0\u00a0(iii) \u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept;\u00a0\u00a0(iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deployment of underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities postured to defeat a countervalue attack;\u00a0(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of a custody layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture;\u00a0\u00a0(vi) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Development and deployment of capabilities to defeat missile attacks prior to launch and in the boost phase;\u00a0(vii)\u00a0 \u00a0Development and deployment of a secure supply chain for all components with next-generation security and resilience features; and(viii) \u00a0Development and deployment of non-kinetic capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0Review relevant authorities and organization of the Department of Defense to develop and deploy capabilities at the necessary speed to implement this directive;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0Jointly with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, submit to the President a plan to fund this directive, allowing sufficient time for consideration by the President before finalization of the Fiscal Year 2026 Budget; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d) \u00a0In cooperation with United States Strategic Command and United States Northern Command, submit to the President:\u00a0(i) \u00a0\u00a0An updated assessment of the strategic missile threat to the Homeland; and(ii) \u00a0A prioritized set of locations to progressively defend against a countervalue attack by nuclear adversaries.\u00a0Sec. 4. \u00a0Allied and Theater Missile Defense Review. \u00a0The United States continues to cooperate on missile defense with its allies and partners to aid in the defense of ally populations and troops and of forward-deployed United States troops. \u00a0Following the submission to the President of the next-generation missile defense reference architecture under section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Defense shall direct a review of theater missile defense posture and initiatives to identify ways in which the United States and its allies and partners can:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Increase bilateral and multilateral cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0Improve theater missile defenses of forward-deployed United States troops and allied territories, troops, and populations; and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0Increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners.Sec. 5.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n    - the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n    - the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 27, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "The document, issued by the President of the United States on January 27, 2025, outlines a directive to develop a next-generation missile defense shield to protect against advanced aerial attacks, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. This effort aims to enhance national security by deploying cutting-edge defense systems and ensuring a secure second-strike capability. The order is a continuation of previous U.S. strategies to maintain military superiority and counter the growing threats posed by peer and near-peer adversaries.\n\nUnder this directive, the Secretary of Defense is tasked with developing a comprehensive plan, including a reference architecture and capabilities-based requirements, for the timely implementation of this defense shield. It emphasizes the importance of accelerating certain technological deployments and strengthening the supply chain's security and resilience. Moreover, the order calls for increased cooperation with allies and partners to improve theater missile defenses internationally, thereby ensuring the protection of allies\u2019 populations and U.S. troops stationed abroad.\n\nThe order also mandates a review of the strategic missile threat to the homeland and identifies prioritized locations for defense deployment, ensuring a methodical approach to counter potential nuclear adversaries. The initiative aligns with the U.S. policy of 'peace through strength' and is subject to the availability of appropriations and existing laws.",
