Washington Convention CenterWashington, D.C.(January 20, 2025)\n\n11:27 P.M. ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Good evening, everybody.\u00a0 How are we doing?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Are we ready to make America great again?\u00a0 (Applause.)I just want to say we\u2019re so grateful to all of you, so grateful for making sure that we made this election too big to rig, because that\u2019s exactly what we did \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and we did it together.And, of course, I want to thank my dear friend, and I think the best president that this country has had, a man \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a man who has put everything on the line for the United States of America and gets an opportunity to serve this great country once again: President Donald J. Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)So, do we want to hear from the 45th and 47th president of the United States?\u00a0 (Applause.)Take it away, sir.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, JD.\u00a0This is a hell of a day we\u2019re having, right?\u00a0 (Applause.)It began very early, and then we decided \u2014 you know, we made a good decision, by the way, doing it in the rotunda, as opposed to in about four degrees with the windchill factor.\u00a0 That would not have been pretty.\u00a0And, you know, if I made us \u2014 did you ever speak in really cold weather?\u00a0 You can\u2019t.\u00a0 They would say \u2014 the fake news over there, they\u2019d say, \u201cHe\u2019s cognitively impaired.\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong with him.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, we didn\u2019t want to give them the chance to do that, did we?We had a \u2014 a great time.\u00a0 We had 72-degree temperature in the rotunda.\u00a0 We had the people that we needed.\u00a0 And we had the people that we need tonight, because you guys are unbelievable.\u00a0 We love you all.\u00a0 (Applause.)And we said a lot of things today.\u00a0 I think we got tremendous reviews on the speech.\u00a0 And, you know, I wanted to put in some really rough stuff, and all of my people, including JD, they said, \u201cYou know, let\u2019s not put that paragraph in.\u201d\u00a0 Oh, I loved that paragraph.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There was a paragraph on \u201cBiden shouldn\u2019t be pardoning his family.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we had a couple of others that were far worse than that.\u00a0But they said, \u201cYou know, the speech is so nice and it\u2019s so unifying.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cAll right, we won\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll do it about two hours later.\u201d\u00a0 So, we\u2019ve done \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 we\u2019ve been doing it all night long.But, you know, we\u2019re going to turn this country around and fast.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have \u2014 we have assets like nobody else.\u00a0 Number one, we have our people.\u00a0 That\u2019s our greatest asset, the people of our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)And I just \u2014 and I have a great family.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 I \u2014 I just look around.\u00a0 My son Eric has been so incredible, married to a woman who became the head of the Republican Party.\u00a0 I wonder, how the hell did that happen?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And she\u2019s \u2014 she really \u2014 her and Michael Whatley, from North Carolina, did a great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)And then you have \u2014 where is my Ivanka?\u00a0 Have you ever heard of Ivanka and Jared?\u00a0 (Applause.)And we have \u2014 Tiffany is here someplace.\u00a0 There\u2019s Tiffany.\u00a0 Have \u2014 with \u2014 with child, I have to say.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Michael.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0And what \u2014 look at that group back there.\u00a0 That\u2019s Kai, our great golfer.\u00a0 She \u2014 a great golfer, that one.\u00a0 (Applause.)And Don and Don and Chloe.\u00a0 Chloe \u2014 I don\u2019t know, Ivanka, she might be as good as this one.\u00a0 You have to see her athletic ability.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 You look at her, she looks so innocent.\u00a0 She\u2019s a killer.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Chloe is a killer.\u00a0And we have a great vice president, I want to tell you, and a fantastic \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and he\u2019s got a fantastic wife and helper, and she\u2019s done \u2014 she\u2019s done just incredible things for the party and for him.\u00a0 And I want to thank you.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Great job. \u00a0JD Vance, great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)So \u2014 so, we\u2019re going to keep it going.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have it turned around quickly.\u00a0 This big ship, we got to turn it a little bit slower than I\u2019d like, but we\u2019re going to turn it around.\u00a0We have things that nobody else has.\u00a0 You know, we \u2014 we also have something that \u2014 it\u2019s not politically correct to say, but it\u2019s becoming very politically correct: We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019re going to use it, right?\u00a0 (Applause.)And we just left the Commander in Chief Ball, which is, like, a similar size.\u00a0 Everyone \u2014 and we\u2019re going to another one in a little while.\u00a0 We needed three because we have such support.\u00a0 There\u2019s a longing for competence in this country.\u00a0 There\u2019s a longing for common sense in this country.\u00a0And I was saying before, with a party of common sense, you know, we \u2014 we don\u2019t want to have men playing in women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to have transgender operations for everyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we just want to have a great country.\u00a0Wan- \u2014 we want education.\u00a0 We want houses that don\u2019t cost a fortune.\u00a0 We want low interest rates.\u00a0 We want low taxes.\u00a0 We want a strong, powerful military, and we\u2019re going to have that.\u00a0We did it once.\u00a0 We did it in 2017.\u00a0 We rebuilt our entire military.\u00a0 It was given away, a lot of it.\u00a0 Can you believe it? Given away \u2014 so foolishly given away, but we\u2019ll have it back again very, very soon.And we\u2019ll be making some announcements.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to be so thrilled.\u00a0But we love you all.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be \u2014 you know, I\u2019d like to say we are a great nation.\u00a0 We will soon be the greatest we\u2019ve ever been, and that won\u2019t take long.\u00a0So, I want to thank you all for being here tonight, special people, and we\u2019ll see you soon.\u00a0 Just watch what happens.\u00a0 Going to be big progress.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)(The Village People perform \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d)MR.
