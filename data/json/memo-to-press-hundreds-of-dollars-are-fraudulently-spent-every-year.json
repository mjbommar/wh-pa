Trump is determined to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and put an end to fraudulent and wasteful spending.\n",
  "summary": "On February 12, 2025, a memo was issued to the press corps highlighting significant fraudulent expenditures within the federal government. In response to an article by the New York Times, which claimed the lack of proof for sweeping accusations of fraud, the memo referenced a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report indicated that no sector of the federal government is exempt from fraud, estimating potential annual losses between $233 billion and $521 billion.\n\nThe memo emphasized President Donald J. Trump's commitment to safeguarding taxpayer money by addressing fraudulent and inefficient spending. The government aims to use available tools and technologies to identify, quantify, and mitigate these instances of fraud to better manage federal expenditures.",
  "eli5": "A lot of money the government spends is getting lost because of cheating, and they want to fix it. They studied it and found out it's a big problem, and they want to make sure people's money is used properly.",
