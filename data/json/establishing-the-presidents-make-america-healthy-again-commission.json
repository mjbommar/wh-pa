2025\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it\u00a0is\u00a0hereby ordered:\n\nSection1. \u00a0Purpose. \u00a0American life expectancy significantly lags behind other developed countries, with pre\u2011COVID-19 United States life expectancy averaging 78.8 years and comparable countries averaging 82.6 years. \u00a0This equates to 1.25 billion fewer life years for the United States population. \u00a0Six in 10 Americans have at least one chronic disease, and four in 10 have two or more chronic diseases. \u00a0An estimated one in five United States adults lives with a mental illness.\n\nThese realities become even more painful when contrasted with nations around the globe. \u00a0Across 204 countries and territories, the United States had the highest age-standardized incidence rate of cancer in 2021, nearly double the next-highest rate. \u00a0Further, from 1990-2021, the United States experienced an 88\u00a0percent increase in cancer, the largest percentage increase of any country evaluated. \u00a0In 2021, asthma was more than twice as common in the United States than most of Europe,\u00a0Asia, or Africa. \u00a0Autism spectrum disorders had the highest\u00a0prevalence in high-income countries, including the United\u00a0States, in 2021. \u00a0Similarly, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis are more commonly diagnosed in high-income areas such as Europe and North America. \u00a0Overall, the global comparison data demonstrates that the health of Americans is on an alarming trajectory that requires immediate action.\n\nThis concern applies urgently to America\u2019s children. \u00a0In 2022, an estimated 30 million children (40.7 percent) had at least one health condition, such as allergies, asthma, or an autoimmune disease. \u00a0Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States \u2014 a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the\u00a0condition during the 1980s. \u00a0Eighteen percent of late adolescents and young adults have fatty liver disease, close to\u00a030 percent of adolescents are prediabetic, and more than 40\u00a0percent of adolescents are overweight or obese.\n\nThese health burdens have continued to increase alongside the increased prescription of medication. \u00a0For example, in the case of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, over 3.4 million children are now on medication for the disorder \u2014 up from 3.2 million children in 2019-2020 \u2014 and the number of children being diagnosed with the condition continues to rise. \u00a0\n\nThis poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life. \u00a0Seventy-seven percent of young adults do not qualify for the military based in large part on their health scores. \u00a0Ninety percent of the Nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures is for people with chronic and mental health conditions. \u00a0In short, Americans of all ages are becoming sicker, beset by illnesses that our medical system is not addressing effectively. \u00a0These trends harm us, our economy, and our security.\n\nTo fully address the growing health crisis in America, we must re-direct our national focus, in the public and private sectors, toward understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease. \u00a0This includes fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, over-reliance on medication and treatments, the effects of new technological habits, environmental impacts, and food and drug quality and safety. \u00a0We must restore the integrity of the scientific process by protecting expert recommendations from inappropriate influence and increasing transparency regarding existing data. \u00a0We must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy.\u00a0 It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to aggressively combat the critical health challenges facing our citizens, including the rising rates of mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. \u00a0To do\u00a0so, executive departments and agencies (agencies) that address health or healthcare must focus on reversing chronic disease.\u00a0 Under this policy:\n\n(a) \u00a0all federally funded health research should empower Americans through transparency and open-source data, and should avoid or eliminate conflicts of interest that skew outcomes and perpetuate distrust;\n\n(b) \u00a0the National Institutes of Health and other health-related research funded by the Federal Government should prioritize gold-standard research on the root causes of why Americans are getting sick;\n\n(c) \u00a0agencies shall work with farmers to ensure that United States food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world; and\n\n(d) \u00a0agencies shall ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Establishment and Composition of the President\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission*.* \u00a0(a) \u00a0There is hereby established the President\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Commission), chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Chair), with the Assistant

Commission shall:\n\n(a) \u00a0study the scope of the childhood chronic disease crisis and any potential contributing causes, including the American diet, absorption of toxic material, medical treatments, lifestyle, environmental factors, Government policies, food production techniques, electromagnetic radiation, and corporate influence or cronyism; \u00a0\n\n(b) \u00a0advise and assist the President on informing the American people regarding the childhood chronic disease crisis, using transparent and clear facts; and\n\n(c) \u00a0provide to the President Government-wide recommendations on policy and strategy related to addressing the identified contributing causes of and ending the childhood chronic disease crisis.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Initial Assessment and Strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission. \u00a0(a) \u00a0*Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment.* \u00a0Within 100 days of the date of this order, the Commission shall submit to the President, through

and threat posed by\u00a0the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs;\n\n(iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identify and report on best practices for preventing childhood health issues, including through proper nutrition and the promotion of healthy lifestyles;\n\n(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0evaluate the effectiveness of existing educational programs with regard to nutrition, physical activity, and mental health for children;\n\n(vi) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0identify and evaluate existing Federal programs and funding

including by ending Federal practices that exacerbate the health crisis or unsuccessfully attempt to address it, and by adding powerful new solutions that will end childhood chronic disease.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Chair may hold public hearings, meetings, roundtables, and similar events, as appropriate, and may receive expert input from leaders in public health and Government accountability.\u00a0\n\nSec. 6.\u00a0 Additional Reports.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Following the submission to the President of the Strategy, and any final strategy reports thereafter, the Chair and the
