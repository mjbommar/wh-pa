and\n\n          (vi)\u00a0\u00a0 derivative products.\n\n   (b) \u00a0In conducting the investigation described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall assess the factors set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1862(d), labeled \u201cDomestic production for national defense; impact of foreign competition on economic welfare of domestic industries,\u201d as well as other relevant factors, including:\n\n           (i)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the current and projected demand for copper in United States defense, energy, and critical infrastructure sectors;\n\n          (ii)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0the extent to which domestic production, smelting, refining, and recycling can meet demand;\n\n         (iii)\u00a0 \u00a0the role of foreign supply chains, particularly from major exporters, in meeting United States demand;\n\n          (iv)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0the concentration of United States copper imports from a small number of suppliers and the associated risks;\n\n           (v)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the impact of foreign government subsidies, overcapacity, and predatory trade practices on United\u00a0States industry competitiveness;\n\n           (vi)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0the economic impact of artificially suppressed copper prices due to dumping and state-sponsored overproduction;\n\n           (vii)\u00a0\u00a0 the potential for export restrictions by foreign nations, including the ability of foreign nations to weaponize their control over refined copper supplies;\n\n          (viii)\u00a0 the feasibility of increasing domestic copper mining, smelting, and refining capacity to reduce import reliance; and\n\n          (ix)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the impact of current trade policies on domestic copper production and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Required Actions*.* \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies as determined by the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate the national security risks associated with copper import dependency.\n\n   (b) \u00a0Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit a report to the President that includes:\n\n          (i)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0findings on whether United States dependence on copper imports threatens national security;\n\n          (ii)\u00a0 \u00a0recommendations on actions to mitigate such threats, including potential tariffs, export controls, or incentives to increase domestic production; and\n\n          (iii)\u00a0 policy recommendations for strengthening the United States copper supply chain through strategic investments, permitting reforms, and enhanced recycling initiatives.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0General Provisions*.* \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n             (i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n             (ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n   (b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n   (c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 February 25, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On February 25, 2025, an order was issued by the President of the United States to address vulnerabilities in the U.S. copper supply chain, which are deemed a threat to national security. The action leverages the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, specifically section 232, to investigate the impact of copper imports on national security. The directive points to the critical role of copper in defense, technology, and infrastructure, coupled with significant reliance on foreign imports.\n\nThe order mandates the Secretary of Commerce to assess the national security implications of various forms of copper imports, considering factors like domestic production capacity, foreign supply chain dependency, and trade policies. A key concern is the U.S.'s reliance on a limited number of foreign suppliers and potential market manipulations. The Secretary of Commerce is required to consult with other government departments and recommend policy actions, such as tariffs or incentives, within 270 days to mitigate these risks.",
  "eli5": "The president is worried that the U.S. doesn't have enough local copper and depends too much on other countries, which could be a problem for safety and the economy. He wants people to study this and suggest ways to make sure we have enough copper.",
