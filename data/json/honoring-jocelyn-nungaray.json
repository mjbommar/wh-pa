  "summary": "The presidential action taken by Donald J. Trump on March 5, 2025, addresses concerns over the previous administration's immigration policies, which, according to the current administration, led to increased crime and threats at the southern border. Among the consequences cited was the tragic murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl, in Houston, Texas, allegedly by illegal immigrants involved with a criminal gang. In her memory, the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas will be renamed as the 'Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge'. \n\nWithin 30 days from the order's issue, the Secretary of the Interior is tasked with implementing the renaming process and ensuring that federal references reflect this change. The action emphasizes honoring Jocelyn by permanently commemorating her life and highlights a critique on prior border policies. It underlines that the changes will be carried out consistent with existing laws and available funding.",
