  "summary": "The document outlines a Presidential order issued on January 20, 2025, concerning the reevaluation and realignment of United States foreign aid. The President of the United States has determined that the current foreign aid paradigm does not align with American interests and may even destabilize global peace by promoting the opposite of harmonized international relations. Therefore, it is mandated that all foreign assistance should align with the President's foreign policy.\n\nA significant component of this order is the implementation of a 90-day pause on foreign development assistance. During this period, the heads of relevant departments and agencies must conduct a thorough assessment of their assistance programs to ensure they align with U.S. foreign policy and operate with programmatic efficiency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will use its authority to enforce this pause. After the review, decisions will be made on whether to continue, modify, or cease each program based on the review's findings and with the Secretary of State's concurrence.\n\nMoreover, any resumption of paused programs or initiation of new foreign assistance programs requires approval by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the OMB. There is also a provision that allows the Secretary of State to waive the 90-day pause for specific programs. The order includes general provisions to ensure it aligns with existing laws and does not create any enforceable rights for individuals.",
