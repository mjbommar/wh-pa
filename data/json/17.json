  "summary": "On January 20, 2025, a series of presidential actions were issued, each addressing various policy areas. These actions include the introduction of the America First Trade Policy, which emphasizes prioritizing American economic interests in trade agreements. Additionally, a memorandum was released to address and resolve the backlog of security clearance issues for personnel within the Executive Office of the President. Furthermore, a national emergency was declared at the southern border of the United States, aiming to address immigration and border security concerns more effectively.\n\nOther notable actions include measures to hold former government officials accountable for election interference and the improper disclosure of sensitive governmental information. There was also a directive to restore accountability for positions within the federal workforce influencing policy, signaling a renewed focus on integrity in government roles. Significant international relations actions were also taken, such as the decision to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization and priorities to protect Americans from foreign adversary-controlled applications, like TikTok. Lastly, pardons and commutations were granted for offenses related to events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, alongside other domestic economic and environmental initiatives.",
