  "markdown": "# \t\t\t\t\tThe Trump-Vance Administration Priorities\t\t\t\t\n\n#### MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN\n\n    - President Trump will take bold action to secure our border and protect American communities.\n    - This includes ending Biden\u2019s catch-and-release policies, reinstating Remain in Mexico, building the wall, ending asylum for illegal border crossers, cracking down on criminal sanctuaries, and enhancing vetting and screening of aliens.\n    - President Trump\u2019s deportation operation will address the record border crossings of criminal aliens under the prior administration.\n    - The President is suspending refugee resettlement, after communities were forced to house large and unsustainable populations of migrants, straining community safety and resources.\n    - The Armed Forces, including the National Guard, will engage in border security, which is national security, and will be deployed to the border to assist existing law enforcement personnel.\n    - President Trump will begin the process of designating cartels, including the dangerous Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations and use the Alien Enemies Act to remove them.\n    - The Department of Justice will seek the death penalty as the appropriate punishment for heinous crimes against humanity, including those who kill law enforcement officers and illegal migrants who maim and murder Americans.\n\n#### MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AND ENERGY DOMINANT AGAIN\n\n    - The President will unleash American energy by ending Biden\u2019s policies of climate extremism, streamlining permitting, and reviewing for rescission all regulations that impose undue burdens on energy production and use, including mining and processing of non-fuel minerals.\n    - President Trump\u2019s energy actions empower consumer choice in vehicles, showerheads, toilets, washing machines, lightbulbs and dishwashers.\n    - President Trump will declare an energy emergency and use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure.\n    - President Trump\u2019s energy policies will end leasing to massive wind farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American energy consumers.\n    - President Trump will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.\n    - All agencies will take emergency measures to reduce the cost of living.\n    - President Trump will announce the America First Trade Policy.\n    - America will no longer be beholden to foreign organizations for our national tax policy, which punishes American businesses.\n\n#### DRAIN THE SWAMP\n\n    - The President will usher a Golden Age for America by reforming and improving the government bureaucracy to work for the American people.

He will pause burdensome and radical regulations not yet in effect that Biden announced.\n    - President Trump is announcing an unprecedented slate of executive orders for rescission.\n    - President Trump is planning for improved accountability of government bureaucrats. The American people deserve the highest-quality service from people who love our country. The President will also return federal workers to work, as only 6% of employees currently work in person.\n    - President Trump is taking swift action to end the weaponization of government against political rivals and ordering all document retention as required by law.

  "summary": "The Trump-Vance Administration outlines its priorities aimed at addressing various national challenges, focusing heavily on enhancing security, revamping energy policies, reforming government operations, and reinstating traditional American values. In efforts to secure America, the administration plans to implement strict border control measures including reversing the current administration's policies, enforcing immigration laws, using military resources for border security, and designating certain criminal organizations as terrorist groups. \n\nThe energy policy will involve undoing previous regulations related to climate change to foster energy independence, rescinding the Paris Climate Accord, and reducing living costs through deregulation. Further governmental reforms are outlined to reduce bureaucracy, improve service accountability, and protect free speech. Additionally, the administration intends to maintain American values by addressing societal issues such as gender identity and historical recognition.",
