Trump\u2019s Joint Address to Congress tonight. Senator Slotkin stands opposed to President Trump\u2019s agenda to lower costs, bring back manufacturing, and secure our borders.\n\nSlotkin voted against overturning Biden\u2019s tailpipe emissions rule, a rule that would force automakers to sell more electric vehicles, killing auto manufacturing jobs. President Trump stood up for American consumers and autoworkers and [repealed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/) this de facto electric vehicle mandate.\n    - Slotkin  voted  against congressional disapproval of Biden\u2019s EPA rule seeking to limit tailpipe emissions.       - The House Budget Committee  called  the regulation \u201ca de facto ban on the sale of gas-powered and traditional hybrid vehicles.\u201d\n      - Research shows that EV mandates would kill thousands of jobs:         - America First Policy Institute : New Report Exposes Biden-Harris\u2019s Proposed EV Mandates to Cost 200,000 American Jobs           - \u201cThe Midwest will suffer the most, with Michigan (-37,000), Indiana (-24,000), and Ohio (-21,000) facing the highest job losses.\u201d \n    - A UAW  study  from 2019 projected that EVs would kill 35,000 jobs at its plants.\n\nSlotkin has repeatedly voted for open borders. President Trump has moved swiftly to secure our borders with attempted crossings in February at the lowest number [ever](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/trump-administrations-immigration-crackdown-leads-to-historic-low-border-apprehensions) recorded.\n    - In May 2023, Slotkin  voted  against the H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.\n    - In February 2019, Slotkin  voted  to terminate President Trump\u2019s declaration of an emergency at the southern border.       - In March 2019, Slotkin again  voted  again to terminate the declaration in an attempt to override President Trump\u2019s veto. \n    - In July 2024, Slotkin  voted  against a resolution \u201cStrongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris\u2019s, failure to secure the United States border.\u201d\n    - Slotkin  said , \u201cI don\u2019t believe that anyone really thinks a wall from sea to shining sea is needed to make us safer.\u201d\n\n**Slotkin is just another out-of-touch politician that wants to hollow out American manufacturing and let criminals flood into our communities.**\n",
  "summary": "The article discusses Senator Elissa Slotkin's response to President Donald J. Trump's Joint Address to Congress on March 4, 2025. Slotkin opposes President Trump's policies aimed at reducing costs, revitalizing American manufacturing, and securing the nation's borders. She has voted against several initiatives that the article suggests are central to Trump's agenda, including measures to overturn Biden's emissions rules and secure the U.S. borders.\n\nSlotkin's legislative actions include voting against repealing an EPA rule that mandates increased electric vehicle sales, which critics argue could harm traditional auto manufacturing jobs. Studies cited in the article suggest these mandates could lead to significant job losses in states heavily reliant on auto manufacturing like Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Additionally, Slotkin's stance on immigration is addressed, noting her votes against border security measures like the Secure the Border Act and her opposition to Trump's emergency declaration at the southern border.",
  "eli5": "There's a talk going on about how Senator Slotkin doesn't agree with President Trump's plans to help Americans save money, make more things in America, and build stronger borders. Some people think her decisions could lead to fewer jobs in car factories and more people coming into the country without controls.",
