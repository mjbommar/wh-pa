all \u201cequity action plans,\u201d \u201cequity\u201d actions, initiatives, or programs, \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.\n\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0 provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:\n\n(A) \u00a0agency or department DEI, DEIA, or \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function;\n\n(B) \u00a0Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; and\n\n(C) \u00a0Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\n\n(iii) \u00a0direct the deputy agency or department head to:\n\n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration\u2019s DEI, DEIA, and \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d programs and policies; and\n\n(B) recommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under 28 U.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal dignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. \u00a0The agency or department head and the Director of OMB shall jointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has the authority and resources needed to carry out this directive.\n\n(c) \u00a0To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a monthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of OPM, and each deputy agency or department head to:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs of DEI, DEIA, and \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d in agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; and\n\n(iii) \u00a0monitor and track agency and department progress and identify potential areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to advance the policy of equal dignity and respect.\n\nSec. 3.\u00a0 Severability. \u00a0If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued to terminate all diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI and DEIA) programs within the U.S. Federal Government. This order aims to reverse the initiatives started under Executive Order 13985 by the Biden Administration, which mandated agencies to submit Equity Action Plans involving DEI measures. The President's directive stresses the reallocation of resources towards programs promoting individual merit without considering DEI factors.\n\nThe order tasks the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, along with the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to spearhead the dismantling of these programs. Each federal agency is instructed to identify DEI-related roles, programs, and activities by a set deadline, and terminate them to the extent legally possible. A monthly meeting will be held to evaluate the order\u2019s implementation, addressing any barriers or areas requiring further presidential or legislative action.\n\nThe order also contains provisions ensuring its alignment with existing laws and appropriations and states that it should not create enforceable rights against the United States. Its severability clause ensures that any invalid portion does not affect the remainder of the order's provisions.",
