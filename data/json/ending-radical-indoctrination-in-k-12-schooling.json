Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.; FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; and the PPRA, 20 U.S.C. 1232h.Sec. 2. \u00a0Definitions. \u00a0As used herein:(a) \u00a0The definitions in the Executive Order \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\u201d (January 20, 2025) shall apply to this order.(b) \u00a0\u201cDiscriminatory equity ideology\u201d means an ideology that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups, rather than as individuals, and minimizes agency, merit, and capability in favor of immoral generalizations, including that:\u00a0(i) \u00a0 \u00a0 Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin;\u00a0(ii) \u00a0 \u00a0An individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;\u00a0(iii) \u00a0 An individual\u2019s moral character or status as privileged, oppressing, or oppressed is primarily determined by the individual\u2019s race, color, sex, or national origin;\u00a0(iv) \u00a0 \u00a0Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to their race, color, sex, or national origin;\u00a0(v) \u00a0 \u00a0 An individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for, should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of, should be discriminated against, blamed, or stereotyped for, or should receive adverse treatment because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin, in which the individual played no part;\u00a0(vi) \u00a0 \u00a0An individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion;\u00a0(vii) \u00a0 Virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex, or national origin;

  "summary": "The executive order titled 'Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling' issued on January 29, 2025, by the President of the United States, aims to address and eliminate perceived radical ideologies in the K-12 education system. The order claims that schools have been promoting anti-American sentiments and ideologies, marginalizing parental oversight, and enforcing divisive concepts like racial discrimination and gender identity issues without parental consent. Furthermore, it asserts that such practices are in violation of specific anti-discrimination laws and parental rights. \n\nThe order mandates the development of an 'Ending Indoctrination Strategy' within 90 days, necessitating the involvement of the Secretaries of Education, Defense, and Health and Human Services, as well as the Attorney General. The strategy should focus on withdrawing federal funding from educational programs promoting these ideologies and ensuring the protection of parental rights. Additionally, the document reinstates the 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education and ensure compliance with laws encouraging educational programs focused on American history.\n\nThe executive order also outlines procedures for agency coordination in enforcing these policies and stipulates the creation of awards and programs to recognize and promote patriotic education. It emphasizes the need for federal monitoring and prioritization of resources to ensure adherence to laws promoting patriotic education and compliance with federally mandated educational programs.",
