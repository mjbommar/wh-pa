and\u00a0 \n\n(ii) \u00a0submit to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs a report that summarizes these steps.\n\n(d)\u00a0 Absent extraordinary operational necessity, the Armed Forces shall neither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\n\n(e)\u00a0 Within 30 days of the issuance of the respective updates, directives, and guidance under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, with respect to the Coast Guard, issue updates, directives, and guidance consistent with the updates, directives, and guidance issued under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section.\n\nSec. 5.\u00a0 Implementing the Revocation of Executive Order 14004.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Pursuant to the Executive Order of January 20, 2025 (Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions), Executive Order 14004 of January 25, 2021 (Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform), has been revoked.\u00a0 Accordingly, all policies, directives, and guidance issued pursuant to Executive Order 14004 shall be rescinded to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this order.\u00a0\n\n(b)\u00a0 The Secretary and, with respect to the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall take all necessary steps to implement the revocations described in subsection (a) of this section and ensure that all military departments and services fully comply with the provisions of this order.\n\nSec. 6.\u00a0 Severability.\u00a0 If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 27, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "# Summary\n\nOn January 27, 2025, a presidential order was issued, emphasizing military excellence and focused readiness of the United States Armed Forces. The order outlines that the military's primary mission is to protect the American people and homeland effectively. It insists on maintaining high standards devoid of political influence, specifically targeting the inclusion of gender identity policies that conflict with traditional military health and discipline standards. The order requires that military personnel must not express a gender identity that is different from their biological sex, claiming such expression undermines the core values necessary for service.\n\nThe directive further explains that individuals with gender dysphoria or those who require specific medical interventions disrupt the core military values and readiness. To implement this, it mandates updates to existing Department of Defense instructions and introduces new guidelines aimed at ensuring uniformity and operational efficiency. Additionally, it revokes a previous executive order allowing all qualified Americans to serve, directing immediate compliance from the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security (for the Coast Guard) with these guidelines.\n",
