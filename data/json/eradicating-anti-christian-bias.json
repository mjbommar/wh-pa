President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Section 1. \u00a0Purpose and Policy.\u00a0 It is the policy of the United States, and the purpose of this order, to protect the religious freedoms of Americans and end the anti-Christian weaponization of government.\u00a0 The Founders established a Nation in which people were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by their government.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For that reason, the United States Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to religious liberty in the First Amendment.\u00a0 Federal laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000bb *et seq.*), further prohibit government interference with Americans\u2019 rights to exercise their religion. \u00a0Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e *et seq.*), prohibits religious discrimination in employment while Federal hate-crime laws prohibit offenses committed due to religious animus.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yet the previous Administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians, while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses.\u00a0 The Biden Department of Justice sought to squelch faith in the public square by bringing Federal criminal charges and obtaining in numerous cases multi-year prison sentences against nearly two dozen peaceful pro-life Christians for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities. \u00a0Those convicted included a Catholic priest and 75-year-old grandmother, as well as an 87-year-old woman and a father of 11 children who were arrested 18 months after praying and singing hymns outside an abortion facility in Tennessee as a part of a politically motivated prosecution campaign by the Biden Administration.\u00a0 I\u00a0rectified this injustice on January 23, 2025, by issuing pardons in these cases.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the same time, Catholic churches, charities, and pro-life centers sought justice for violence, theft, and arson perpetrated against them, which the Biden Department of Justice largely ignored. \u00a0After more than 100 attacks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning this violence and calling on the Biden Administration to enforce the law.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, in 2023, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum asserted that \u201cradical-traditionalist\u201d Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as \u201cthreat mitigation.\u201d\u00a0 This later-retracted FBI memorandum cited as support evidence propaganda from highly partisan sources.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Biden Department of Education sought to repeal religious-liberty protections for faith-based organizations on college campuses.\u00a0 The Biden Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sought to force Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith. \u00a0And the Biden Department of Health and Human Services sought to drive Christians who do not conform to certain beliefs on sexual orientation and gender identity out of the foster-care system.\u00a0 The Biden Administration declared March 31, 2024 \u2014 Easter Sunday \u2014 as \u201cTransgender Day of Visibility.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In this atmosphere of anti-Christian government, hostility and vandalism against Christian churches and places of worship surged, with the number of such identified acts in 2023 exceeding by more than eight times the number from 2018.\u00a0 Catholic churches and institutions have been aggressively targeted with hundreds of acts of hostility, violence, and vandalism.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My Administration will not tolerate anti-Christian weaponization of government or unlawful conduct targeting Christians.\u00a0 The law protects the freedom of Americans and groups of Americans to practice their faith in peace, and my Administration will enforce the law and protect these freedoms.\u00a0 My Administration will ensure that any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sec. 2. \u00a0Establishing a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0There is hereby established within the Department of Justice the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias (Task Force).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 The Attorney General shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0In addition

  "summary": "On February 6, 2025, a Presidential Action was issued to address anti-Christian bias and protect religious freedoms in the United States. The order outlines a policy to stop governmental actions perceived as targeting Christian practices and individuals, especially those who were accused of anti-abortion activities under the previous administration. The current administration emphasizes the protection of religious liberty, citing U.S. constitutional rights and other laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nTo implement these changes, the order establishes a Task Force within the Department of Justice to identify and rectify alleged anti-Christian conduct by governmental bodies. The task force is chaired by the Attorney General and includes several cabinet members and agency heads. It will review past governmental actions, develop protective strategies for religious liberties, and report its findings to the President. The task force aims to enhance enforcement against anti-Christian acts and suggest necessary legislative or executive measures to safeguard religious practices.\n\nMoreover, the order mandates that the Task Force submits various reports on their findings and progress within specified timeframes. This executive move comes amid reported increases in hostility against Christian institutions and aims to ensure that the government upholds protections against discrimination and hostility based on religion.",
