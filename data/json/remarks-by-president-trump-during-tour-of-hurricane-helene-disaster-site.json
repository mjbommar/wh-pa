EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Franklin.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 A good man.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a great job, a fantastic job.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019ve come to North Carolina with a simple message for all the people of this region who were hit so hard by Hurricane Helene.\u00a0 And that message is very simple: You are not forgotten any longer.\u00a0 You were treated very badly by the previous administration.\u00a0 And I\u2019m here after a few days of the administration.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to California, Los Angeles.\u00a0 They got hit hard, as you know.\u00a0 A lot of that could have been prevented, I think, if they had water, which they had plenty of, but they didn\u2019t use it.\u00a0\n\nBut I\u2019m going there, but \u2014 and it was set up to go there, and I said, \u201cWell, wait a minute, what about North Carolina?\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cWell, what.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to stop there first.\u00a0 I\u2019m stopping in North Carolina.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo, we made the stop, and I feel very good.\u00a0 You\u2019re represented by some great people.\u00a0 Great, great congressmen are with us, and we\u2019re going to get involved with them.\u00a0\n\nAnd Michael Whatley is here, who is the head of the Republican Party.\u00a0 He worked with Lara Trump to take us through to a tremendous victory, one of the \u2014 as the media says, one of the most consequential presidential elections ever \u2014 they say in 129 years, whatever that may mean.\u00a0\n\nBut whatever it is, it was a great election we had, and we won your state.\u00a0 All three times, we won your state.\u00a0 And all three primaries, we won your state.\u00a0 So, we won it six times, I guess, Mr. Congressman, huh?\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s a great place.\u00a0 And I wanted to come here and before I went anywhere, frankly.\n\nIn the campaign, I promised that I\u2019d come back to western North Carolina to help the people of the state.\u00a0 And today, here I am to deliver on that promise.\u00a0 And we have a lot of things in mind, and we\u2019re getting the Army Corps of Engineers all set.\u00a0 You need your riverbanks fixed.\u00a0 You need a lot of roads fixed.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to get it done in rapid time.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve asked Susie Wiles and all of my people to start calling up and get the Corps ready, and they\u2019re going to get ready to go.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what it is \u2014 I don\u2019t know what took so long for the other administration.\u00a0\n\nBut remember, I wasn\u2019t here for the first four months or three months, whatever it may be.\u00a0 See, we can only start as of, essentially, one or two days ago.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last couple of days, Michael.\n\nI understand we\u2019re going to get you the resources you need and the support that you deserve, and we\u2019ll be at your side through every step of the rebuilding.\u00a0 And no American is going to be left behind.\u00a0 The people that I just met are so great, and the people that own that house is going to be very beautiful in a little while.\u00a0 And who knows, if Franklin decides, maybe he\u2019ll rip it down and build them a new one, because sometimes he can do that just as easily.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to take care of the people.\n\nI want to thank our great first lady for coming today.\u00a0 She really wanted to be here.\u00a0 She said, \u201cNo, I want to go.\u201d\u00a0 And, you know, she sees what happened and she felt very badly, and she wanted to go.\u00a0 And we\u2019re then going out together to Los Angeles, but she wanted to be in North Carolina.\u00a0 She saw what happened.\u00a0 She has a \u2014 she has a feeling like I do for North Carolina.\n\nSo, thanks, as well, to a great gentleman, Franklin Graham.\u00a0 And his father, Billy Graham \u2014 I used to go with my father to Yankee Stadium and places to watch his father preach.\u00a0 And he was some preacher.\u00a0 Where is he \u2014 he was some \u2014 you got good stock.\u00a0 You come from the ultimate genes, I can tell you.\u00a0 But he was really something.\n\nAnd Franklin, though, has done so much, and his father is looking down on him right now, I guarantee you.\u00a0 For a long time, he\u2019s been looking down on Franklin, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, son.\u201d\u00a0 He really is, because what Franklin has done with Samaritan\u2019s Purse is incredible.\u00a0 They told me just yesterday that Samaritan\u2019s Purse has been great.\n\nBut the FEMA people sort of left you high and dry, but we\u2019re going to change that around.\u00a0 We\u2019re not happy with FEMA.\n\nAs well as all of the representatives \u2014 you have great representatives here.\u00a0 Chuck Edwards, who\u2019s here someplace.\u00a0 Where is Chuck?\n\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Right here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where is Chuck?\u00a0 Chuck?\n\nTim Moore.\u00a0 Tim \u2014 thank you, Tim.\u00a0 Great job too, both of you guys.\n\nVirginia Foxx, a power \u2014 she\u2019s a power, that one.\u00a0 Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t ever have her as your enemy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not good.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s not healthy.\n\nPat Harrigan.\u00a0 Good job, Pat.\u00a0\n\nAddison McDowell.\u00a0 These guys were just here, just put in, and they\u2019re doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 Addison, thank you very much.\u00a0 Great.\n\nMark Harris.\u00a0 Thank you, Mark.\u00a0 Thank you, Mark.\n\nBrad Knott.\u00a0 Thank you, Brad.\n\nGreg Murphy, a fantastic guy \u2014 my friend for a long time now, right?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE MURPHY:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And the RNC chairman, Michael Whatley, who really, as I said, brought us to a great victory with Lara the chairman of the party, the whole Republican \u2014 I took Michael Whatley from North Carolina, because he did the best job, and put him in charge of everything.\u00a0 And the job they did together was incredible.\n\nLast September, Hurricane Helene became one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern American history.\u00a0 Rainfall rose to far more than 30 inches, which is lethal, unleashing unprecedented devastation throughout western North Carolina and many other states, as you know, but you got hit the hardest.\n\nThe highest responsibility and deepest obligation of the American government is to protect its people, and that\u2019s never truer than in times of emergency like this.\u00a0 Unfortunately, our government failed you, but it wasn\u2019t the Trump government.\u00a0 It was a government run by Biden.\u00a0 What a terrible situation.\u00a0 But our government failed the people of North Carolina in this horrible crisis.\u00a0\n\nFor two months, Asheville lacked running water.\u00a0 And even today, some North Carolinians can\u2019t take a hot-water shower.\u00a0 They can\u2019t drink water.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know where to get it.\u00a0 They have to \u2014 it\u2019s delivered to them by somewhere.\u00a0 They just go out and somehow find some.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since the storm made ~~landfill~~ [landfall], and still 180 roads remain closed and in ruins.\u00a0 Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing, 20-degree weather \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they did that one, because it was cold \u2014 even while your government provided shelter and housing for illegal aliens from all over the world.\n\nBut under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over.\u00a0 They are over.\u00a0\n\nAs I said in my Inaugural Address, we restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of the American government. \u00a0And I think I said most of it in the Inaugural Address.\u00a0 We said a lot of things, but one of the groups of people I was thinking about is you in North Carolina.\u00a0 A lot of that was in reference to you and what you\u2019ve had to suffer.\n\nI\u2019m pleased to announce that under our leadership, the federal government will be surging housing solutions to the state that go beyond mere temporary hotel stays that ended up being very short term.\u00a0 The government wouldn\u2019t do it any longer, which is ridiculous.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll marshal all available resources that bring back potable water and make your water and infrastructure dramatically more reliable very quickly.\u00a0\n\nAnd today, I\u2019ll also be signing an executive order slashing all red tape and bureaucratic barriers and permits to ensure the rapid reconstruction of the roads here in western North Carolina.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to go through a permitting process that\u2019s called \u201cNo permitting.\u00a0 Just get it done.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s the way they built them many years ago, I guarantee you that.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0\n\nWe will get them back very quickly.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll begin the work of funderv- \u2014 fundamentally changing, terminating, or overhauling FEMA.\u00a0 FEMA has been a disaster, no matter where they are.\n\nWe\u2019re honored to be joined today, very quickly, by several families affected by the vicious storm.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to ask each of them to share their story.\u00a0 Chris and Kim West, you can come forward.\u00a0 Ramona Nix, Jackie Mitchell, and Thomas Gary Bright, and finally, the Wright family.\u00a0 And come on up and maybe say a few words.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\nHello.\n\nMS. WEST:\u00a0 Hi.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Come on in here.\n\nMS. WEST:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Whenever it started, we started moving our vehicles to the top of the road.\u00a0 And by the time we got the vehicles moved, the water had already hit our ankles in the house.\u00a0 And so, I grabbed my purse and my little pug dog, and my husband grabbed the dog food and put it in a trash bag.\u00a0 And by the time we got out into the driveway, it was already waist deep, and there was sticks and that kind of thing.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was going to make it, but we did make it out, and we made it to the top of the road.\u00a0 And we were kind of stuck there for hours because we couldn\u2019t get out any other ways, because it was flooded all the way around.\u00a0 It took us hours, and we sat there.\u00a0\n\nAnd finally, it receded enough to where we could actually get out.\u00a0 It was probably, like, close to midnight.\u00a0 And it started like, 5, 6 o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nWe just lost everything that we had.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t even have a brush for, like, three days.\u00a0 So \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Come on over.\n\nMS. WEST:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nMR. WEST:\u00a0 That \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0\n\nWould you like to say something with that beautiful baby?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Say, \u201chey.\u201d\n\nYeah.\u00a0 So, when the hurricane storms hit North Carolina, hit our home, my daughter and my wife and I were actually out of town.\u00a0 But unfortunately, my dad, who was still home, and my mother was staying at our house with our \u2014 with our animals.\u00a0\n\nAnd my \u2014 the waters got so high that it actually lifted \u2014 between that and the tornado that came through \u2014 or microburst is what they\u2019ve been calling them \u2014 and lifted his home and the house that I grew up in and crashed it into our barn.\u00a0 It took away his business.\u00a0 It took away all of our tools and tractors and everything needed to keep the farm going.\u00a0\n\nAnd my mother was trapped in the house, and there was no way to escape because the water got so high.\u00a0 The only thing she could do was ride it out and wait until the waters came down.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve been doing a little bit of battling with our insurance and FEMA.\u00a0 We did have proper insurance, with flood insurance and homeowner\u2019s insurance, but since we had proper insurance, FEMA has not been able to assist us with a whole lot of things.\u00a0\n\nAnd, again, we\u2019ve been having some issues with trying to get some payout for our insurance in a timely manner.\u00a0 We had to do mold mitigation on our home, which is extremely expensive, before the structural engineer even came out in order to get our flood payout.\u00a0 And to me, that was not really acceptable.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Has the insurance company been responsive, or not really?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Not \u2014 not so much.\u00a0 You know, again \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Are they going to give you they have to give you?\u00a0 Huh?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m hoping so.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 And we might need \u2014 I mean, we need some assistance with that.\u00a0 We reached out to an attorney.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What\u2019s the name of the insurance company?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 North Carolina Farm Bureau.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You\u2019ve got a mortgage, right?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Yep.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s terrible.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re after here.\u00a0 So \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Are a lot of people having that problem too with the insurance companies, general?\u00a0 Different insurance companies?\u00a0 And they\u2019re all difficult, or just the one particular one?\u00a0\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard different stories from others, and a lot of folks are \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Have you heard some were responsive, that some were good?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard some \u2014 some good instances of even Farm Bureau themselves.\u00a0 But in my case, you know, they\u2019d sent out a third-party adjuster immediately.\u00a0 Well, they wound up firing that third-party adjuster group.\u00a0 He gave us a quote for a much higher estimate than what we received.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And he got fired?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 And then he got let go.\u00a0 Yeah, he got fired.\u00a0 So, then they brought in another third-party adjuster to come in and lowball us.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve not received any kind of \u2014 so, the flood insurance is our primary insurance.\u00a0 And so, there was roof leaks in the home that the inspectors found \u2014 the adjusters.\u00a0 Well, that contributed to us losing some of our personal property, as it come in the third story, where there\u2019s no \u2014 or second-story living space, where the flood wa- \u2014 well above the flood waters.\u00a0 So, they\u2019ve neglected us for \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Was your mother saved?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Yes, yes, she was saved.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 She\u2019s right here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, good.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 You made it.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 So, we \u2014 yeah, we made it.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That was not exciting, right?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 How scared were you?\n\nMS. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Very.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did you think you were going to make it?\n\nMS. WRIGHT:\u00a0 No.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You didn\u2019t think so?\n\nMS. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I just started praying.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, you were sort of on a boat?\u00a0 Your house became a boat, huh?\n\nMS. WRIGHT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 It\u2019s a big pontoon.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s some story.\u00a0\n\nWould you like to say something?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 It was a beach house on \u2014 on the steps.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll bet this guy would like to say something, I can tell.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 I was next door to the house, and my son was out of town.\u00a0 So, when he came in to Charlotte \u2014 to my sister\u2019s, he called about 2:00 in the morning, because at midnight, the water was still in the stream.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 In \u2014 within the banks.\u00a0 So, when he called, the water was coming up.\u00a0 So, I started moving vehicles up to about 5:30 in the morning.\u00a0 And she was in the house, and I pulled up to the steps, and I said, \u201cHop on the fender, and I\u2019ll get you out.\u201d\u00a0 Well, it \u2014 he built a beach house on stilts \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 \u2014 five times higher than the floodplain.\u00a0\n\nAnd she said, \u201cWell, he said I\u2019d be okay.\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 \u201cSo, I\u2019m staying with the dogs.\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 So, I went to higher ground with some vehicles, hers included, and the water covered everything.\u00a0 But I\u2019d already seen it coming around both sides of my place, so I got my blind and deaf dog and a bag of valuables and took up off the side of the hill behind my house.\u00a0 And then was heading to the cemetery back there because I knew it was open, because there was trees falling \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 \u2014 and right uprooting.\u00a0 It was raining.\u00a0 I mean, it was \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You never saw anything like that before?\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been through floods \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 There\u2019s never been anything like that before.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 \u2014 all my life around here.\u00a0 Never, no.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Never been anything like it.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But you\u2019ve okay, right?\u00a0\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Yep.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Come here.\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 House is destroyed.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, well, we\u2019re going to help you out there.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to help you out.\u00a0\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Appreciate you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u00a0\n\nMR. WRIGHT:\u00a0 Thanks for being here.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Anybody else?\u00a0 You guys okay?\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Please.\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 Our day that morning began \u2014 I\u2019m a little taller \u2014 with some trees falling into our house, which our house is \u2014 goes back four generations, 80 years, and never came close to flooding.\u00a0 And we woke up with trees about 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning.\u00a0\n\nAnd our house sits three tenths of a mile back off the road.\u00a0 And the water \u2014 you know, we\u2019ve had flooding and such in the lake, but nothing like we saw.\u00a0 And like most everybody else, we moved five vehicles as far up \u2014 lawnmowers and everything else.\u00a0 And the water started coming in the house.\n\nAnd when it got up to about ankle high, we have a loft.\u00a0 I got her up in that and tried to gather what you might want, which was totally random.\u00a0 And when it made it to the loft and started getting up to about our hips, I built a little makeshift ladder, and we got out on our roof.\u00a0 And we spent four hours on the roof.\u00a0 I had a little baggie.\u00a0 I \u2014 I di- \u2014 I did notes on my cell phone to my two kids and my two grandkids and something to identify me, in case we were lost in it.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did you think you were going to make it?\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 We \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, you didn\u2019t think so?\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 Yeah, we didn\u2019t think we were going to make it at all.\u00a0 I mean, our house was 25 feet underwater.\u00a0 And \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u00a0So, you didn\u2019t think you were going to live?\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 No, we were watching houses, trailers, bodies coming by us.\u00a0 And we live in the Azalea Road area of \u2014 in East Asheville.\u00a0 Oteen.\n\nMS. MITCHELL:\u00a0 We watched our garage lift up and float away.\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 Yeah, we watched our garage float by.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It just lift up?\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, we \u2014 we got to a point where it crested about four feet up on the roof.\u00a0 We took about three or four hours for it so it could kind of do everything in reverse and got out in the mud to higher ground.\u00a0 And I got out \u2014 higher ground, up toward the Subway and got over to her daughter\u2019s house, where \u2014 when she saw that I didn\u2019t have her, she lost it.\u00a0 And I was like, \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u00a0 She\u2019s alive.\u201d\u00a0 And we tried to make our way back in there and gather things best we could.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, found a body right away.\u00a0 We had \u2014 there was about eight bodies in our area that first two weeks, located.\u00a0 And we were lucky we weren\u2019t one of them and \u2014 and blessed.\u00a0\n\nBut like other people, no insurance on flood insurance, so we \u2014 we had to depend on FEMA.\u00a0 They did what they could do.\u00a0 And, of course, it\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, no, I know.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

NIX:\u00a0 I\u2019m Pastor Nix.\u00a0 Our church is right down the road.\u00a0 We had only purchased in May, and it\u2019s a big church.\u00a0 We\u2019re a small congregation.\u00a0 And I had people say, \u201cWhat are you going to do with this big building?\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cOnly God knows.\u201d\u00a0 And we had our dedication, and the storm came the next week.\n\nAnd the outpouring of people \u2014 my son brought the first load of supplies.\u00a0 And from there, I stayed there for about three months.\u00a0 I slept on the floor for about three weeks because the need was so great.\u00a0 The people were so devastated.\n\nAnd I said, \u201cI want to be here for them.\u201d\u00a0 And they were coming in just day and night, so there\u2019s really no need for me to go home.\u00a0\n\nBut we had people from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, Oklahoma \u2014 people from all over.\u00a0 We have not received any help \u2014 like, from the government \u2014 anything.\u00a0 But I said, \u201cLord, if you want us to do that\u201d \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Inaudible) helped you?\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 People.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, they came from all over the \u2014\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 All over the states.\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 (Inaudible) groups, that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what did it.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But FEMA \u2014 FEMA did nothing, right?\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 No.\n\nMR. BRIGHT:\u00a0 It was the \u2014 it was the \u2014 the locals.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 FEMA is a waste of time and money.\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 The locals and the people that \u2014 that knew us.\u00a0\n\nAnd before the week was over, our church was so packed with supplies, we couldn\u2019t even \u2014 we couldn\u2019t even walk.\u00a0 Even in our sanctuary, it was up to the platform \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 \u2014 of things, and in our halls and in our rooms.\u00a0 And we\u2019re just now beginning to get a little straightened out.\u00a0\n\nBut somebody said, \u201cHow long are you going to be here?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be here through the winter and even on, if possible,\u201d because when you meet people that\u2019s been through this struggle \u2014 I had a little lady come up, and I said, \u201cCan we do anything special for you?\u201d\u00a0 And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be selfish,\u201d but said, \u201cCould I have a cup of coffee?\u201d\u00a0 And I handed her that coffee, and she stood there, and tears just poured.\u00a0\n\nShe said, \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how \u2014 how important the \u2014 the little things.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s not the big things in life that we have, but it\u2019s the little things and \u2014 and knowing that God is our source.\u00a0 I don\u2019t look to man.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to have a lot of things.\u00a0 I \u2014 I had trees \u2014 about 20 trees down in my yard, but that didn\u2019t really matter.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter, because the needs of the people is what \u2014 is what I want to be there for.\u00a0\n\nAnd God is good.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s very good.\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 He\u2019s very good.\n\nAnd my daughter \u2014 now, she \u2014 her house is really in bad shape.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll let her tell you about that.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 But thank you, President.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 This is our president.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nMS. NIX:\u00a0 We appreciate you so much.\n\nTHE FIRST LADY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank for all what you do.\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 I live out in the Fairview area of North Carolina and the \u2014 near the Bat Cave, Lake Lure area, and our area was hit \u2014 it was hit really hard.\u00a0 I \u2014 I was home alone, and my husband had stayed in town because we take care of a little lady that\u2019s 98 years old, and she lives out in the woods by herself.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cJust stay with her and make sure that she\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd I got up the next morning, and my first thought was, \u201cI want to go see what our road and bridge looks like.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSo, as I was making it down to the road and the bridge, there was no road and bridge.\u00a0 And so, you know, here we are.\u00a0 We\u2019re, like, in a little island.\u00a0 You know, we can\u2019t access the main road or anything.\u00a0\n\nAnd then the fire department came by the next day and said that they were evacuating me and my neighbor because a landslide was going to come, and they told me to get my stuff and get ready.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, while I was getting my stuff and getting ready, there was a knock at the door.\u00a0 So, I thought it was the fireman.\u00a0 And I went to the door, and there stood my 21-year-old son \u2014 his name is Nathan \u2014 and he had drove as far as he could to get to me.\u00a0 But he hiked five miles, and it took him a really long time.\u00a0 And he got there, and he said \u2014 he said, \u201cMom, grab a bag.\u00a0 We got to go.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cSon, there\u2019s no way I can \u2014 I can hike out of here.\u201d\u00a0 And he\u2019s like, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWe got to go.\u201d\n\nSo, we \u2014 we started hiking out, and I \u2014 and I seen one of my neighbors who \u2014 she had no clothes on.\u00a0 Her \u2014 her \u2014 she was \u2014 her skin was \u2014 was, like, chunked up.\u00a0 It was just \u2014 she was blue.\u00a0 She had been \u2014 she had been in the \u2014 in the waters.\u00a0 And where she had went or \u2014 or \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but it \u2014 horrific, is just all I can say.\u00a0\n\nBut then, as \u2014 as me and my son hiked on out, we went through where this \u2014 this place \u2014 we call it Craigtown \u2014 but there were, like, a lot of family members there that passed away \u2014 like 11 of them.\u00a0 And \u2014 and there \u2014 there were people out everywhere looking for their loved ones.\u00a0 And there were \u2014 there were dead bodies, you know?\u00a0 My son\u2019s like, \u201cMom, you\u2019re going to see things you don\u2019t want to see.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd so, anyway, we got through all that, but I stayed at our church in our sound booth.\u00a0 My husband and I, we just slept up in the sound booth for a couple of months because we didn\u2019t have power or anything for about two months out there.\n\nAnd then we \u2014 we have went back.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been fighting with FEMA since day one.\u00a0\n\nOur community \u2014 there\u2019s, like, 32 homes.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a road and a bridge.\u00a0 We\u2019re driving through our neighbors\u2019 property.\u00a0 You know, I went to EMS, and I said, \u201cLook, my concern is, if we have a fire or we have an emergency out here, you\u2019re not going to get to us.\u00a0 You can\u2019t get those big trucks up here.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd \u2014 and I\u2019ve called and called and called FEMA.\u00a0 And, you know, I said it\u2019s \u2014 this happened on September 27th.\u00a0 That\u2019s four months ago.\u00a0 Well, for us, today is still September 27th.\u00a0 You know, we haven\u2019t had help.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, when I talk to FEMA, I\u2019m explaining the road and the bridge, and they send me a letter that tells me to \u2014 to basically fix it and send in my receipts, and they\u2019ll refund me some money.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking at a road and bridge that, honestly, the bridge itself is probably going to be $300,000, and the road could be close to that also, because we have to have \u2014 the community has to have big boulders brought in.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a rich community.\u00a0 We can\u2019t fix it ourself.\u00a0\n\nYou know, it\u2019s just \u2014 and as far as, like, house repairs, I\u2019m still pending.\u00a0 I can\u2019t get money from FEMA until I fix the road and bridge and fen- \u2014 and send in my \u2014 my proof that it\u2019s fixed and everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s been a nightmare.\u00a0 And I totally feel like \u2014 that we have been forgotten.\u00a0\n\nIf it had not been for \u2014 for our fellow American citizens who stepped up to help us, I don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u00a0 I have \u2014 I have five neighbors around me who completely lost everything.\u00a0 You know, I have damage to my house and \u2014 and I feel \u2014 I don\u2019t feel entitled.\u00a0 I\u2019m embarrassed to even say I need help, because, you know \u2014 and sometimes there\u2019s even that \u2014 that survivors\u2019 guilt, is what they\u2019re calling it.\u00a0 But you feel guilty to even be alive sometimes, you know, when you look around and you see your neighbors that are gone.\n\nAnd it\u2019s just, you know \u2014 we \u2014 we need help.\u00a0 I wrote a letter that \u2014 to send to Congress.\u00a0 You know, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 If we can\u2019t get FEMA help, then will you guys help us?\u00a0 Will you step up and be our fellow citizen?\u00a0 Will you step up and be our neighbor and send us something.\u00a0 Help us.\u00a0 Help us get our community back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u2014 I could go on.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u00a0\n\nI appreciate you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nA good daughter you have, huh?\u00a0 A good daughter.\u00a0 Take care of mom.\u00a0 And your son must be great.\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 My son is great.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, he sounds like a real leader and smart.\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 He really is.\u00a0 Th- \u2014 to hike in \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, how would you have been if he didn\u2019t come and get you?\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d just been \u2014 would have been there until \u2014 because the only thing we could do \u2014 there were no way to get out there.\u00a0 The only thing we could do is just hike up to the church, the first church that was up there \u2014 about three miles to \u2014 to get, you know, maybe what we needed \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You tell him he\u2019s just \u2014\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 \u2014 or some \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Tell him he\u2019s a real leader.\n\nMS. NIX-ROPER:\u00a0 He is.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sounds good.\n\nWell, again, thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to be here.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be working with our congressmen and woman, and they\u2019re going to do a job.\u00a0 And Michael Whatley is going to be very much in charge, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u00a0\n\nAnd FEMA is ready to rock.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t done the job, because they weren\u2019t really told to do the job by Biden.\u00a0 I guess Biden was thinking about other things, wasn\u2019t he?\u00a0 But they weren\u2019t told.\u00a0\n\nWhat they did to \u2014 what the past administration did to North Carolina is a disgrace.\u00a0\n\nSo, I just want to wish you all well.\u00a0 I was here right after the event, and I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 I have never seen anything like it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen a lot of bad things, but I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s an honor to meet the people behind me, and it\u2019s an honor to be with our congressional delegation and some of the other politicians in the area.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to have Michael Whatley at my side, because maybe we wouldn\u2019t be standing here as president if he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nHim and Lara \u2014 Lara Trump \u2014 were unbelievable as the head of the Republican Party.\u00a0 So, he happens to come from a place called North Carolina.\u00a0 So, I said, \u201cMichael, fix it.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 So, good luck.\u00a0 Good luck.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll supply what you need.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\n\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what kind of role will Mr. Whatley have?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, I\u2019m hearing all these heartbreaking stories and how there\u2019s been so many local groups \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 who have stepped up to \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 assist these families.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the things you hear.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there any talk on having money \u2014 instead of going to FEMA and going through the bureaucracy \u2014 to go through them?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, that\u2019s what I want to do.\u00a0 We want to bring it locally so that a state takes care of its problem, and then they can bring it down to a local level, like Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Franklin, because that\u2019s, you know, one of the better examples.\u00a0 But you had numbers of people that did a great job.\u00a0 You have groups that did a great job and organizations.\n\nThe one that didn\u2019t do a good job was the government.\u00a0 They did a bad job.\u00a0 They did in many ways, they did no job.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t even available.\u00a0\n\nSo, good question.\u00a0 The answer is: We go local. I think it will work much better.\u00a0\n\nFEMA is a very expensive organization that really doesn\u2019t work out very well.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t.\u00a0 This is not the only example.\u00a0\n\nSo, if it was up to me right now, I\u2019d end it right now, and I\u2019d just let the state take care of the problem.\u00a0 I mean, you\u2019re going to always have problems.\u00a0 Let the state \u2014 if it\u2019s Florida, it\u2019s a hurricane, let Florida take care of it.\u00a0 They don\u2019t need FEMA to come in.\u00a0\n\nYeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What kind of role do you envision for Mr. Whatley?\u00a0 Is it within FEMA, outside of FEMA?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I envision a very important role for him.\u00a0 It\u2019s any role he wants.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very capable guy.\u00a0 Michael Whatley, a very capable guy.\u00a0 And he\u2019s friends and works with these guys.\u00a0 Keeps them elected, right?\u00a0 They have to do a good job.\u00a0 Otherwise, no matter how good Michael is, not going to work.\u00a0 But they\u2019ve done an amazing job.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been great.\n\nYou\u2019re lucky.\u00a0 You have great congressmen here and \u2014 and -woman, by the way \u2014 a great woman, very powerful woman.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to do a great job.\u00a0 They\u2019ll do it together.\u00a0 They\u2019ll work together, and we\u2019ll supply what they need as they need it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll coordinate that.\n\nAnd we will immediately get the Army Corps, Michael, because you need roads built.\u00a0 You know, we\u2019re talking about the bridge, we\u2019re talking about roads and things, so we\u2019ve got to get them built.\u00a0\n\nAll right?\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0\n\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nEND \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01:10 P.M.

  "summary": "President Trump visited Asheville, North Carolina, on January 24, 2025, to address the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. He expressed his commitment to aiding affected residents who felt neglected by previous administrations. Trump criticized the Biden administration\u2019s response to the disaster and pledged swift action from the federal government, including the involvement of the Army Corps of Engineers, to rebuild infrastructure such as roads and riverbanks.\n\nDuring his visit, President Trump met with local residents and heard firsthand accounts of their experiences with the hurricane. Many shared stories of loss and frustration with insurance companies and FEMA. He reassured them of his administration's commitment to providing necessary support and resources. Trump announced plans to streamline bureaucratic processes to expedite recovery efforts and proposed a local approach to disaster management, bypassing FEMA in favor of direct state involvement.\n\nTrump praised the efforts of organizations like Samaritan's Purse for their effective on-the-ground response. He emphasized the importance of local community help over federal assistance, suggesting that states manage their own disaster responses. The President underscored this approach as more effective, highlighting that the federal government would still offer support to ensure rapid recovery.",
