EST\n\n\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 This is very beautiful, I must say.\u00a0 This is a beautiful place.\u00a0 And our country is starting to do very well again.\u00a0 It\u2019s happening fast \u2014 a little faster than people thought.\u00a0\n\nThank you especially to Senator Marshall for the beautiful introduction.\u00a0 Appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Great senator you are.\u00a0\n\nI also want to thank a friend and a man of profound faith and tremendous patriotism who\u2019s also become a great friend.\u00a0 You become much friendlier when you have a majority of two or three or four.\u00a0 Could even be five pretty soon.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But for a little while, it was one.\u00a0 That\u2019s Mike Johnson, speaker.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mike \u2014 very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd thanks, as well to somebody who\u2019s doing a fantastic job: Senator Thune.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Senator.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 It\u2019s really great.\u00a0\n\nAnd Leader Scalise \u2014 Steve, wherever you may be.\u00a0  I think you\u2019re here someplace. \u00a0There he is.\u00a0 A brave guy, too.\u00a0 A brave guy.\u00a0 I always say it.\u00a0\n\nAnd Senator Chuck Schumer.\u00a0 Chuck, thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nSenator Hassan, thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Very nice to see you.\u00a0\n\nCongressman Jeffries, thank you.\n\nAnd many other very distinguished leaders in the room.\u00a0 Great, great group of people.\u00a0 If we could ever come together, it would be unbelievable.\u00a0 It may not happen, but it should and maybe it will.\u00a0\n\nFrom the earliest days of our republic, faith in God has always been the ultimate source of the strength that beats in the hearts of our nation.\u00a0\n\nWe have to bring religion back.\u00a0 We have to bring it back much stronger.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the biggest problems that we\u2019ve had over the last fairly long period of time.\u00a0 We have to bring it back.\u00a0\n\nThomas Jefferson himself once attended Sunday services held in the old House Chamber on the very ground where I stand today, so there could be nothing more beautiful than for us to gather in this majistic place \u2014 it is majestic \u2014 and reaffirm that America is and will always be \u201cone nation under God.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAt every stage of the American story, our country has drawn hope and courage and inspiration from our trust in the Almighty.\u00a0 Deep in the soul of every patriot is the knowledge that God has a special plan and a glorious mission for America.\u00a0 And that plan is going to happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 I hope it happens sooner rather than later.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s His hand that guides us every single step of the way.\u00a0 And all of you and the things we have to do is to see the defining role that faith and prayer have played in the life of our nation.\u00a0 And you just have to look at this building, and you can look at each other.\u00a0 You can really look at each other.\u00a0 It\u2019s defined almost everyone in this room.\u00a0 I think faith has been very strong with the people in this room.\u00a0\n\nJust steps away from here, in the Hall of Columns, is the statue of John Winthrop, who famously proclaimed that America would stand as \u201ca city upon a hill, a light to all nations with the eyes of all people upon us.\u201d\n\nToday, almost 400 years after that famous sermon, we see that with the Lord\u2019s help, the city stands taller and shines brighter than ever before \u2014 or at least it soon will.\u00a0\n\nIn that same hall, we also find the statue of the great Roger Williams, who founded the state of Rhode Island, named its capital city Providence, and built the First Baptist Church in America.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s Williams that we have to thank for making religious liberty part of the bedrock of American life.\u00a0 And today we must protect the fundamental freedom with absolute devotion.\u00a0 We must stand strong, just like generations of Americans have done on the battlefields all around the world.\u00a0\n\nFeet away from the magnificent rotunda, another statue watches over visitors to the Capitol.\u00a0 George Washington, the founder of our country, often called for Americans to join together in prayer \u2014 very often.\u00a0 And more than two centuries later, this morning, we heed President Washington\u2019s wisdom and follow in his mighty footsteps.\u00a0 He was a strong man and of great religious strength.\u00a0\n\nThe stories of legends like Washington, Winthrop, and Williams remind us that without faith in God, there would be no American story.\u00a0 Every citizen should be proud of this exceptional heritage.\u00a0 We have an unbelievable heritage, and we have to use that and make life better for everyone.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why, as we approach the 25th-times-10 anniversary \u2014 think of that, 250; 250 years we\u2019ll be celebrating next year \u2014 of our country\u2019s founding, I have signed an executive order to resume the process of creating a new national park full of statues of the greatest Americans who ever lived.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to be honoring our heroes, honoring the greatest people from our country.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to be tearing down.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be building up.\u00a0\n\nIt will be called the National Garden of American Heroes.\u00a0 Some of you will be on that soon-to-be hallowed ground \u2014 some of you.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 I can pick a few of you right now by looking \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 because there\u2019s a couple of you right now, I can see.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s the president\u2019s sole opinion.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019ve given myself a 25-year period \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and then somebody else.\u00a0 By that time, it will be very, very built up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nNo, it will be something very special, and I hope that Congress will fully fund this wonderfully unifying project at the first possible opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be a lot of money; going to be very important, however \u2014 so that more of our people can be inspired by the faith and courage of patriots like those who we honor in these halls.\u00a0 One of the incredible Americans whose memory my order will celebrate is also recognized with a statue in the Capitol, representing the great state of North Carolina, and that\u2019s a man known \u2014 who everybody loved: Reverend Billy Graham.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was something.\u00a0 My father used to take me to watch the \u201cCrusades.\u201d\u00a0 He would take me to Yankee Stadium.\u00a0 I remember it so well.\u00a0 I remember it more than I remember any Yankee game, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of Yankee games.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Can you believe it?\u00a0 And Billy didn\u2019t have a bat, so, you know, he\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0 It was amazing.\u00a0 You\u2019d have 60- or 70,000 people, and they loved him.\u00a0 They loved him.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I saw him with Franklin.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Franklin is here.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve gotten to know Franklin.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a great job with helping on tragedies, on problems like in North Carolina, California.\u00a0 He\u2019s always the first one there.\u00a0 The work he does is \u2014 his father is very proud of him, I can tell you that.\u00a0 But Billy Graham was very special.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One floor below us, Reverend Graham\u2019s statue stands with an open Bible, the page turned to a letter from the apostle Paul, which reads, \u201cLet us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season, we will reap if we do not give up.\u201d\u00a0 Never give up.\u00a0 Never ever give up.\u00a0 You can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How about me?\u00a0 If I would have given up, I would not be here right now.\u00a0 Who the hell knows where I\u2019d be?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It might not be a good place.\u00a0 If it was up to the Democrats, it would not be a good place at all.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Never ever give up.\u00a0 There could be no better message for the leaders gathered here \u2014 and you are real leaders \u2014 that we must never give up, and we must never grow tired.\u00a0 We must never grow weary, and we always must practice good.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As you know, last week, only a few miles from here, our nation witnessed a terrible tragedy when 67 people were killed in a horrible accident near Reagan Airport.\u00a0 As one nation, we take solace in the knowledge that their journey that night did not end in the icy waters of the Potomac, but in the warm embrace of a very loving God.\u00a0 None of us knows exactly when our time on Earth will be over.\u00a0 You never know.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A truth I confronted a few short months ago when there was an incident that wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was not fun.\u00a0 It was not a good thing.\u00a0 But God was watching me.\u00a0 The chances of me being here \u2014 my sons are shooters.\u00a0 They\u2019re really good shooters, Don and Eric.\u00a0 And they said the chances of missing from that range with that gun are \u2014 but Don equated it to a one-foot putt.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty bad.\u00a0 Two feet I can see missing.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But one foot you can\u2019t miss.\u00a0 It was the equivalent of a one-foot putt, is what he told me.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He said \u2014 in fact, he gained some religion.\u00a0 He gained \u2014 he went up 25 percent.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And if you know him, that\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But he said, \u201cThere had to be somebody that saved you, and I think I know who it is.\u201d\u00a0 And he looked up.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cWhoa, Don, that\u2019s come \u2014 you\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a good guy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But they my two sons just really couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 Had I not turned that right turn just at that time \u2014 and the audience \u2014 55,000 people standing this way.\u00a0 There were just a few people in the back on the bleachers.\u00a0 There was nobody over there, except for my all-time favorite chart in history, a chart on immigration.\u00a0 Immigration saved my life.\u00a0 See?\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to be good for immigration, okay?\u00a0\n\nBut had I not made that turn \u2014 boom \u2014 and quickly.\u00a0 It was almost as though a deer bolted.\u00a0 You know, they say the only way you miss when you\u2019re a good shot is if it bolts?\u00a0 I bolted.\u00a0 I turned to the right to look at the chart, and I said, \u201cWow, what was that?\u00a0 What was that?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you never know, but God did that.\u00a0 I mean, it had to be.\u00a0 The chances of turning, because there\u2019s no reason to turn to the right.\u00a0 You know, the chart is rarely brought down.\u00a0 I brought it down maybe 20 percent and \u2014 20 percent of the time.\u00a0 And it\u2019s never on my right.\u00a0 It\u2019s always on my left.\u00a0 And it\u2019s always at the end of the speech, never the beginning of the speech.\u00a0\n\nAnd if I was a little more than that 90-degree angle, it would be no good.\u00a0 And if I was a little less, it would be no good.\u00a0 It had to be perfect.\u00a0 The thing went \u201cshhh\u201d right along the edge.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t affect my hair.\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It might\u2019ve touched it.\u00a0 Might have touched it, but not where it counts, not \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 not the skin part.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But it changed something in me, I feel.\u00a0 I feel even stronger.\u00a0 I believed in God, but I feel much more strongly about it.\u00a0 Something happened.\u00a0 And so \u2014 (applause) \u2014 thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But that event, like the tragedy last week, should remind us all that we have to make the most out of every single day that we have. \u00a0Who would think that you\u2019re in space and two things collide?\u00a0 The odds of that happening are so small, even without proper control.\u00a0\n\nWe should have had the proper control.\u00a0 We should have had better equipment.\u00a0 We don\u2019t.\u00a0 We have obsolete equipment.\u00a0 They were understaffed, for whatever reason.\u00a0 I guess the helicopter was high, and we\u2019ll find out exactly what happened.\u00a0 But the odds, even if you had nothing \u2014 if you had nobody, the odds of that happening are extremely small.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s like, did you ever see \u2014 you go to a driving range in golf and you\u2019re hitting balls, hundreds of balls, thousands of hours.\u00a0 I never see a ball hit another ball.\u00a0 Balls going up all over the place.\u00a0 You never see them hit.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0It was amazing that that could happen.\u00a0 There was a lot of mistakes made, and it should have never happened.\u00a0 But\n\nregardless of that, it\u2019s amazing that it happened.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0And I think that\u2019s going to be used for good.\u00a0 I think what is going to happen is we\u2019re all going to sit down and do a great\n\ncomputerized system for our control towers, brand-new \u2014 not pieced together, obsolete, like it is \u2014 land-based \u2014 trying to hook up a land-based system to a satellite system.\u00a0\n\nAnd the first thing that some experts told me when this happened is you can\u2019t hook up land to satellites, and you can\u2019t hook up satellites to land.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0 And we spent billions and billions of dollars trying to renovate an old, broken system, instead of just saying, \u201cCut it loose, and let\u2019s spend less money and build a great system.\u201d\u00a0 Done by two or three companies \u2014 very s- \u2014 good companies, specialists.\u00a0 That\u2019s all it is.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They used 39 companies.\u00a0 That means that 39 different hookups have to happen.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know how many people of you are good in terms of all of the kind of things necessary for that \u2014 and it\u2019s very complex stuff \u2014 but when you have 39 different companies working on hooking up different cities and different people \u2014 you need one company with one set of equipment.\u00a0\n\nAnd there are some countries that have unbelievable air controller systems, and they would have \u2014 bells would have gone off when that helicopter literally even hit the same height, because it traveled a long distance before it hit.\u00a0 It was just like \u2014 just wouldn\u2019t stop \u2014 you follow the line.\u00a0 But bells and whistles would have gone off.\u00a0 They have them where it actually could virtually turn the thing around.\u00a0 It would have just never happened if we had the right equipment.\u00a0\n\nAnd one of the things that\u2019s going to be \u2014 I\u2019m going to be speaking to John and to Mike and to Chuck and to everybody.\u00a0 We have to get together and just \u2014 as a single bill, just pass where we get the \u2014 the best control system.\n\nWhen I land in my plane, privately, I use a system from another country, because my captain tells me \u2014 I\u2019m landing in New York, and I\u2019m using \u2014 I won\u2019t tell you what country, but I use a system from another country, because the captain says, \u201cThis thing is so bad.\u00a0 It\u2019s so obsolete.\u201d\u00a0 And we can\u2019t have that.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to have the best system and it\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not that much money.\u00a0 And it\u2019ll happen fast, and it\u2019ll be done by total professionals.\u00a0 And when it\u2019s done, you\u2019re not going to have accidents.\u00a0 It\u2019s just not \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re virtually not possible to have.\u00a0\n\nEach of us is blessed with a precious chance to help lead America to renew our pledges of faith and everything else and bring us to new heights and create a future of promise for our people and for ourselves.\u00a0\n\nYou know, we have the most important people in the country, in a true sense, here, because you\u2019re the ones that are going to make the decision.\u00a0 You\u2019re the ones that are leading us into so many different things, whether it\u2019s the right air control system or the right size military or what to do and what not to do \u2014 most important people.\n\nAnd many of you are very religious.\u00a0 I know so many of you are very religious.\u00a0 And I just think that our country has been so badly hurt.\u00a0 We\u2019re very hurt by what COVID did to religion.\u00a0 It really hurt it badly.\u00a0 People couldn\u2019t go to church for a long period of time.\u00a0 Even going outside, they were given a hard time.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not blaming anybody for that, but \u2014 but it was very hard to gather.\u00a0\n\nSo, they start using computers, if that.\u00a0 And when they come back, it\u2019s just, you know, a whole new experience they have to get used to.\u00a0 But it is starting to come back.\u00a0\n\nWe had a fantastic thing happen yesterday.\u00a0 The Army had the best recruitment numbers that they\u2019ve had in more than 15 years.\u00a0 They think it could be 25 years, actually \u2014 they\u2019re going to probably put that out \u2014 but more than 15 years just now.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd we were worried about it.\u00a0 We were talking about it numerous times that, you know, we don\u2019t have people joining our military services.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have people joining our police force.\u00a0 We have to cherish our police.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s so dangerous.\u00a0 You open a car and somebody starts shooting.\u00a0 They have blackened windows.\u00a0 You don\u2019t even have any idea who\u2019s in the car.\u00a0 Oftentimes, they have the dark windows \u2014 which they\u2019re not, in theory, supposed to have, but they have them.\u00a0 The door opens and a gun is pointed at your face, and you can\u2019t do a thing about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s just nothing you\u2019re going to do about it.\u00a0 Your friends will take them out, and it\u2019s happened so many times, but you just \u2014 it\u2019s so \u2014 such a dangerous thing.\u00a0 We have to cherish these people.\u00a0\n\nSo, today, we join our hearts and prayers in recommitting to putting our country first.\u00a0 We have to put our country first, making America stronger and greater and more exceptional than ever before.\n\nAnd we have to make religion a much more important factor now.\u00a0 We have to make it an important factor.\u00a0 And if we do that, it\u2019s going to be \u2014 our job is just going to be much easier.\u00a0 It unifies people.\u00a0 It brings people together.\u00a0 Democrats are going to be able to have lunch again and dinner with Republicans.\u00a0\n\nAnd I remember, just as \u2014 growing up, I\u2019d see \u2014 you know, I revered senators and congressmen as something very special, but they were out to dinner all the time.\u00a0 We had an old congressman, maybe some of \u2014 Sey Halpern from Queens,\n\nand he was a friend of my father.\u00a0 But he\u2019d have dinner with \u2014 he was a Democrat, but he would have dinner with Republicans, and he\u2019d be at it.\u00a0 It wouldn\u2019t even make a difference.\n\nToday, it\u2019s like shocking.\u00a0 And it shouldn\u2019t be.\u00a0 You have to get together.\u00a0 We really have to get together.\u00a0\n\nWe all know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\n\nthere\u2019s going to be compromise on both sides, but we have to just do the right thing, and we have to get together. \u00a0\n\nYou did it with Marco Rubio.\u00a0 He got everybody who was \u2014 99 votes.\u00a0 And the only vote was our VP, who \u2014 who maybe we should have been there just to make it a hundred, but I think I would have been angered if it was a hundred.\u00a0 That might be a step too far, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But, no, it was great to see a vote.\u00a0\n\nPam Bondi had support from Democrats, and some of the others had some pretty good support.\u00a0 So, you know, it\u2019s doable.\n\nWe had a recent bill having to do with a very beautiful young lady who was killed from Georgia, and that bill was very bipartisan.\u00a0 It was a very beautiful thing to watch, actually.\u00a0 And so, I think we just have to \u2014 if possible, we have to unify.\n\nThere\u2019s big division.\u00a0 I mean, some people want an open border and some people want a closed border.\u00a0 We want it closed, and they want it open.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s a big difference.\u00a0 How do you solve that problem?\u00a0 It\u2019s a big difference.\u00a0\n\nSome people want men in women\u2019s sports and some people don\u2019t.\u00a0 And I was with somebody yesterday who was so upset that the bill was signed, where men cannot participate in women\u2019s sports.\u00a0 And I said \u2014 he\u2019s a very smart guy \u2014\n\nwent to a great school, was a great student.\u00a0 And he actually feels, you know, that that should happen: Men should be able to play \u2014 meaning transition into women sports.\n\nAnd you talk to him, and it\u2019s just \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t understand it.\u00a0I think it \u2014 I don\u2019t understand how the problem ever got started in the first place.\u00a0 It just seems so simple.\n\nBut he\u2019s a good person and just believes it.\u00a0 He just believes it.\u00a0 Not going to be easy to convince him otherwise.\u00a0\n\nSo, where is a middle ground?\u00a0 It\u2019s just hard to have a middle ground if there\u2019s two ways.\u00a0 I mean, you can either do it or you can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nBut I think a lot of good things are going to happen.\u00a0 You know, a lot of people might be surprised to hear me say that, of all people, but I think a lot of good things are going to happen.\u00a0 Because our country has got some big headaches, but we have tremendous spirit right now.\u00a0\n\nThe spirit is as high as it\u2019s been.\u00a0 It was up 49 points this morning \u2014 49 points.\u00a0 That\u2019s the biggest increase in the history of whatever the poll was.\u00a0\n\nSo, the spirit is there.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big factor.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably the hardest thing to get back, to be honest.\u00a0 The rest is easy.\u00a0 The rest is easy.\u00a0\n\nSo, I want to just thank you all.\u00a0 I want to congratulate a lot of the new members.\u00a0 I see so many of you that ran great races.\u00a0 David, that was a great race.\u00a0 But so many that ran great races.\u00a0 And on both sides, you ran some incredible races.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s good to be with you.\u00a0\n\nAnd God bless everybody.\u00a0 We want to come together.\u00a0 And the happiest \u2014 the person, the element, the everything that\u2019s going to be happy.\u00a0 People of religion are going to be happy again.\u00a0\n\nAnd I really believe you can\u2019t be happy without religion, without that belief.\u00a0 I really believe it.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t see how you can be.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nSo, let\u2019s bring religion back.\u00a0 Let\u2019s bring God back into our lives.\u00a0\n\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Great honor.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nEND
