EST\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 How we doing?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Isn\u2019t it a great day to make the 45th president of the United States the 47th president of the United States?\u00a0 (Applause.)Just say, first of all, thank you to all of you for your support, for your kindness, for your friendship, for believing enough in this country to fight for it and make Donald J. Trump the president America needs at this moment in time.\u00a0 (Applause.)We love you, and we\u2019re grateful to you.\u00a0And, second, I want to thank the president for his trust that he\u2019s placed in me but, most importantly, for the willingness to sacrifice, to serve, to fight through all \u2014 let\u2019s be honest and call it what it is \u2014 fight through all of the lies and the bullshit to serve the American people.\u00a0 (Applause.)So, I want to introduce the 45th and 47th president of the United States.\u00a0 And we are lucky to have him.God bless you all.\u00a0 (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, JD.\u00a0 And it\u2019s great to have you all.\u00a0 And, by the way, JD is doing a great job.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 We picked \u2014 we picked the right person.\u00a0 (Applause.)But I especially want to thank the people in this room.\u00a0 You know, many of you are donors.\u00a0 Some of you are large donors.\u00a0 You believed in us very early.\u00a0 Some of you believed in us from 2015.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But you believed in us \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people out there.\u00a0And \u2014 and 2016 was a great year.\u00a0 And then we did much better in 2020, much \u2014 we got 10 or 12 million more votes.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know what happened, but I knew \u2014 I said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing this again. \u00a0We\u2019re going to make it too big to rig.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s what happened.We had the best numbers anyone has ever seen in the history of the Republican Party, actually.\u00a0 Got the biggest vote in the history of the Republican Party and I guess in most of the history of the Democrat Party too, because we won in a landslide.\u00a0 We won the seven swing states, and we won the popular vote.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice to be popular.\u00a0 It\u2019s very nice to be popular.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we won it \u2014 we won it by millions of votes.So, I just want to thank everybody, because this really is a very special room.\u00a0 And this is the one we chose to come to last.\u00a0 That\u2019s supposed to be a good thing, and it is a good thing, because we have so many friends in the crowd but, really, friends that supported us.We had a \u2014 an incredible day today at the inauguration, and I\u2019ve gotten good reviews on the speech.\u00a0 You know, they made me take some of the rather difficult things \u2014 Melania said to me, \u201cYou know, you could do without a couple of those paragraphs.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And we listened, and we listened to some others.We have some tremendous professionals.\u00a0 Susie Wiles is doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 (Inaudible.)And we had great people \u2014 great people on the campaign.\u00a0 The campaign was so beautiful.\u00a0 That last 120 days, I didn\u2019t sleep one night.\u00a0 I mean, literally, we just kept going, going, going \u2014 no days off, no vacation days.\u00a0 And we kept hearing the other side was going to take a couple of days off during the week.\u00a0I remember there were 14 days, then 17 days, and I heard that our opponent was going to take about 5 days off.\u00a0 I said, \u201cHow do you do that when you\u2019re going for the big one?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0But we worked very hard.\u00a0 And I really think we outworked them, but we also out-thought them.\u00a0 Work is wonderful, but you have to be able to think.\u00a0And now we have the job of bringing our country back because we have the embarrassment of having other countries dumping prisoners and mental institution patients into our country with a stupid open border.\u00a0As you know, the border was closed at exactly 1:05 in the afternoon today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I don\u2019t mean closed; I mean really closed.\u00a0 It\u2019s closed.And we\u2019re going to \u2014 we have no choice.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I want to do this.\u00a0 Dwight Eisenhower, a very moderate president, has the record.\u00a0 He just couldn\u2019t stand when people poured into the country.\u00a0 He has the record for getting people out that shouldn\u2019t be here.\u00a0 And, you know, we\u2019re going to far exceed that \u2014 not that I want to brag about it, because I hate having to do it.\u00a0They should have never done this to our country.\u00a0 They should have never let this happen.\u00a0 You know that this is happening with countries all over the world, and you know their crime rates are going down by 10 and 15 and 20 percent every six months?\u00a0 Venezuela, their crime rate is down by 74.2 percent because they took their street criminals, their prisoners, and their mental patients, and they brought them into the United States of America.\u00a0 Who the hell can think that\u2019s a good thing?\u00a0 But we\u2019re getting them out, and we\u2019re strengthening everything we have.\u00a0We have something that nobody else has.\u00a0 We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And if you don\u2019t mind \u2014 now, if you do mind, I will not do it \u2014 if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019re going to use it.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to use it.And \u2014 and through a system of good deals and renegotiating all of these terrible deals \u2014 we made some good \u2014 really good ones in 2016, but some of the best ones we made were terminated by this Biden administration and gave them back everything they wanted, these other countries, even if they\u2019re allies.\u00a0And we have some allies from countries right in this room \u2014 big, big people in countries.\u00a0 So, I hate to embarrass them, but some of our allies are really \u2014 they treat us worse than the enemies on trade.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u00a0So, we\u2019re going to do things that really started three months ago. \u00a0We won the election, and that was a big, big \u2014 November 5th, that was a big day.\u00a0 And I want to make that the most consequential election in the history of our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be the most consequential.We\u2019re going to turn it around very fast. \u00a0It\u2019s a big, big ship, but we\u2019re turning it as fast as a big ship can be turned.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to make America great again.\u00a0 (Applause.)And I just want to thank everybody in \u2014 in this large room, because it\u2019s packed.\u00a0 And the beautiful thing is we have two other rooms that are massive, and you couldn\u2019t get in.\u00a0 No matter what you did, you couldn\u2019t get in.\u00a0 And it\u2019s just a great tribute to everybody here and to the people on stage.My family has been so great.\u00a0 Everyone in this \u2014 on this floor.Did \u2014 has anybody ever heard of Eric Trump?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He\u2019s got more subpoenas than anybody in the history of the United States.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They were after their political opponent.\u00a0 How did that work out?\u00a0 Not so good.They got us a lot of votes.\u00a0 Can you believe it?\u00a0 That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s ever happened, actually.\u00a0But I just want to thank everybody very much, and I want to thank our first lady.\u00a0 People love our first lady.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And she\u2019s done a fantastic job.And we\u2019re going to have a tremendous four years, and hopefully it\u2019s going to go long beyond four years.\u00a0 We have some tremendous talent, including this guy right here.\u00a0 Hopefully, it\u2019s going to go long beyond four years.\u00a0So, again, I want to thank you for your confidence.\u00a0 I want to especially thank those people \u2014 JD \u2014 that were here in 2015 before I really started.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a lot of them in the room, and they just stuck.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cWe got to do it again, sir.\u00a0 We got to do it again.\u201d\u00a0 And we did it again, and we won in record fashion.\u00a0 So, it was a landslide.\u00a0 It was a mandate like nobody has had before.\u00a0So, thank you all very much.\u00a0 We love you all.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to do a real job for you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12:24 A.M.
