  "markdown": "[About The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/)\n\n# \t\t\t\t\tAir force one\t\t\t\t\n\nThe President of the United States must be ready to travel anywhere in the world on a moment\u2019s notice. Fortunately, modern presidents have access to a variety of transportation options \u2014 including flying aboard Air Force One.\n\nTechnically, \u201cAir Force One\u201d is used to designate any Air Force aircraft carrying the President, but it is now standard practice to use the term to refer to specific planes that are equipped to transport the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nToday, this name refers to one of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. The Air Force designation for the aircraft is VC-25A.\n\nAir Force One is one of the most recognizable symbols of the presidency, spawning countless references not just in American culture but across the world. Emblazoned with the words \u201cUnited States of America,\u201d the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States, it is an undeniable presence wherever it flies.\n\nCapable of refueling midair, Air Force One has unlimited range and can carry the President wherever he needs to travel. The onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States.\n\nInside, the President and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the President that features a large office, lavatory, and conference room. Air Force One includes a medical suite that can function as an operating room, and a doctor is permanently on board. The plane\u2019s two food preparation galleys can feed 100 people at a time.\n\nAir Force One also has quarters for those who accompany the President, including senior advisors, Secret Service officers, traveling press, and other guests. Several cargo planes typically fly ahead of Air Force One to provide the President with vehicles and services needed in remote locations.\n\nAir Force One is maintained and operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office. The Airlift Group was founded in 1944 as the Presidential Pilot Office at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. For the next 15 years, various propeller-driven aircraft served the President until President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to Europe aboard VC-137A, a Boeing 707 Stratoliner, in August 1959.\n\nIn 1962, President John F. Kennedy became the first President to fly in a jet specifically built for presidential use \u2014 a modified Boeing 707. Over the years, several other jet aircraft have been used, with the first of the current aircraft being delivered in 1990 during the administration of President George H.W. Bush.\n",
  "summary": "Air Force One is the official aircraft used by the President of the United States, enabling rapid travel to any location worldwide on short notice. The designation 'Air Force One' applies to any Air Force plane carrying the President, but it primarily refers to two distinctively modified Boeing 747-200B series aircraft. These aircraft, with tail codes 28000 and 29000 and designated as VC-25A by the Air Force, are equipped with advanced security and communications technologies, making them mobile command centers.\n\nThe planes have the ability to refuel midair, granting them virtually unlimited range. Inside, there is ample space spread over three levels, featuring a presidential suite, conference room, and a medical facility that can function as an operating room. The aircraft also possesses two kitchens capable of preparing meals for up to 100 people. The Presidential Airlift Group handles the operation and maintenance of these planes, a unit founded in 1944 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nThroughout history, Air Force One has been an iconic symbol of the presidency. The development of this fleet reflects technological advances in aviation and the increasing mobility demands on the President. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy flew in the first jet specifically built for the President's use, and the current fleet began service in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush's administration.",
