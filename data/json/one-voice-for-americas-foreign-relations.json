  "summary": "On February 12, 2025, a Presidential Order was issued outlining the responsibilities and authority vested in the President of the United States, particularly in the area of foreign relations. The order clarifies that all foreign policy must be implemented under the President's direction and supervision. It stresses the importance of a dedicated workforce to achieve these aims, largely overseen by the Secretary of State. This workforce includes members of the Foreign Service, Civil Service employees, and other relevant staff. \n\nThe order mandates that any failure to faithfully execute the President's foreign policy could result in professional disciplinary action. The Secretary of State is tasked with reforming the Foreign Service to ensure effective implementation of foreign policy. Reforms include changes in recruiting, performance evaluation, retention standards, and updates to training programs at the Foreign Service Institute.\n\nAdditionally, the order provides the Secretary with the discretion to make preliminary decisions regarding referrals to the President when dealing with appointed officials who may require personnel actions. The guidelines emphasize that these reforms and their execution should adhere to applicable laws and should not interfere with existing authorities or budgetary considerations.",

If people working for the government don't follow this, they might get in trouble. They also want to make sure that people working on these things are very good at their jobs!",
