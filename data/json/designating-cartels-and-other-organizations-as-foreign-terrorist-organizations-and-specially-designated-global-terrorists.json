and\n\n(iii)\u00a0 infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs.\n\nThe Cartels functionally control, through a campaign of assassination, terror, rape, and brute force nearly all illegal traffic across the southern border of the United States. \u00a0In certain portions of Mexico, they function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society.\u00a0 The Cartels\u2019 activities threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Their activities, proximity to, and incursions into the physical territory of the United States pose an unacceptable national security risk to the United States.\n\n(b)\u00a0 Other transnational organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pose similar threats to the United States.\u00a0 Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n(c)\u00a0 The Cartels and other transnational organizations, such as TdA and MS-13, operate both within and outside the United States. \u00a0They present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \u00a0I hereby declare a national emergency, under IEEPA, to deal with those threats.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to ensure the total elimination of these organizations\u2019 presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States through their extraterritorial command-and-control structures, thereby protecting the American people and the territorial integrity of the United States.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Implementation. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to make a recommendation regarding the designation of any cartel or other organization described in section 1 of this order as a Foreign Terrorist Organization consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1189 and/or a Specially Designated Global Terrorist consistent with 50 U.S.C. 1702 and Executive Order 13224.\n\n(b)\u00a0 Within 14 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to make operational preparations regarding the implementation of any decision I make to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. 21 *et seq*., in relation to the existence of any qualifying invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States by a qualifying actor, and to prepare such facilities as necessary to expedite the removal of those who may be designated under this order.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 20, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "### Summary\n\nOn January 20, 2025, a Presidential directive was issued to classify certain international cartels and organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists. This directive utilizes the powers granted under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the national security threat posed by these entities. The order highlights the complex, violent operations of these cartels, noting their influence over illegal border activities and certain areas in Mexico where they operate almost like governing bodies. Organizations such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, alongside the cartels, represent a significant danger to the United States' national security and regional stability.\n\nThe order mandates a detailed process whereby the Secretary of State, in coordination with other key agencies, must make recommendations for the designation of such organizations under the specified legal frameworks. The directive empowers the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare for any necessary actions under the Alien Enemies Act, should a qualifying threat emerge. The order underlines the objective of eradicating these groups' influence and ensuring the security of U.S. citizens and territory.\n\nThe implementation of this order is to respect existing laws and is dependent on available budgetary resources. The directive does not, however, create any enforceable rights for individuals against the U.S. government.",
