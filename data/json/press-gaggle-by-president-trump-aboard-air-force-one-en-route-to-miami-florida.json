PST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Welcome back, Mr. President.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0 How are you?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Welcome back.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Welcome back to you.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How are you liking Air Force One so far, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think it\u2019s nice.\u00a0 Hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hasn\u2019t changed very much.\u00a0\n\nHow\u2019s everything going?\u00a0 Good?\u00a0 Everybody happy?\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, very much so.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You\u2019re getting a little bit more access to your president than you did the last time, slightly \u2014 like, by about 5,000 percent.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nWe had a very good week \u2014 first week.\u00a0 Almost complete.\u00a0 I guess one day is left, if you think about it.\u00a0 We\u2019re heading to Florida.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be at Doral because I\u2019m making a speech there the following day for a group \u2014 a very important group.\u00a0 And then, I guess we come back to Washington.\n\nSo, we\u2019re heading, as you know, to Miami \u2014 Doral.\u00a0\n\nOkay.\u00a0 Any questions?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to get a round of golf in?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 It\u2019s so busy.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u2019s your favorite part on the plane, Mr.\u00a0President?\u00a0 What do you like \u2014 you know?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Which plane?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like, this one.\u00a0 Air Force One.\u00a0 When you were back, what did you like \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The plane?\u00a0 No, I\u2019ve been on the plane many, many times, as you know.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great plane.\u00a0 It\u2019s a special plane.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you still want to change the colors?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you still want to change the colors \u2014 the exterior?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I would change them.\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 It\u2019d be a much more appropriate plane, rather than the baby blue.\u00a0 We want power blue, not baby blue.\u00a0\n\nBut no, you know, this is nice, but everything has its time and place.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be changing the colors.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you talk to us about the firing of the inspectors general?\u00a0 Why did you do that?\u00a0 And is it the \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because it\u2019s a very common thing to do.\u00a0 And not all of them.\u00a0 Michael Horowitz, we\u2019re keeping.\u00a0 I thought his report on Comey was incredible, actually.\u00a0 It was such an accurate, well-done report.\u00a0 I only wish Bill Barr used it, which he chose not to.\u00a0 But it was \u2014 it was an incredible report.\u00a0 Michael Horowitz wrote the definitive report on James Comey and the FBI.\u00a0 It really got that going.\u00a0\n\nAnd I understand.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know them, but some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing the job.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a very standard thing to do, very much like the U.S. attorneys.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you plan to bring your own people in those positions, Mr. President?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Which people?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2014 in the \u2014 in the inspectors general role?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s not my people.\u00a0 They\u2019re not my people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know anybody that would do that, but we\u2019ll put people in there that will be very good.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, there\u2019s reports that Elon Musk now must go through Susie Wiles and that he doesn\u2019t have an office in the West Wing.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious if \u2014 how you feel about that.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, not \u2014 it\u2019s not Elon\u2019s office.\u00a0 We have an office that\u2019s set up for purposes of \u2014 when I do an executive order, that the order is carried out, not that it sits around for three months.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have about 20 people, maybe more, working out of that office.\u00a0 It\u2019s really an office for a lot of people that go and make sure that the executive office \u2014\n\nYou know, when I do an executive document, very important executive do- \u2014 I want to make sure that that is done.\u00a0 And there\u2019s about 20 or 25 people that will be working out of that office, and it\u2019s really a \u201cgo get \u2018em\u201d office to make sure it gets done.\u00a0 That\u2019s what that is.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you\u2019re a week in now to your presidency.\u00a0 How does it compare to your first week in 2017?\u00a0 Did you learn any lessons or are you trying to do something differently?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I come in now with great knowledge and experience and you could say that no \u2014 if you call it \u201cnew president\u201d has ever had this kind of experience, that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0 Whereas before, I had never done it before, but we did well.\u00a0\n\nWe had a very \u2014 we had a great presidency, but this one could be really outstanding.\u00a0 I think you\u2019re seeing the same reports that I see.\u00a0 And you write the reports.\u00a0 Most of you are writing the important reports.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting A-pluses on the work done and also the amount of work done.\u00a0 I mean, nobody else has done this.\u00a0\n\nYou go to North Carolina.\u00a0 Then you go to Los Angeles.\u00a0 And then you stop on the way home and \u2014 and that was \u201cno tax on tips,\u201d but it was really a stop to thank the people of Nevada for having been \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a very hard state to win as a \u2014 as a Republican, and we won it very conclusively.\u00a0 So, it was really more of a thank you to the people of Nevada.\u00a0 So, I stopped there.\u00a0 And I have a lot of meetings once I get back, once I get to Miami.\u00a0\n\nBut no, it\u2019s \u2014 I think we had \u2014 people are saying it was the most successful first week that anybody can remember a president having.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you were so nice to Governor Newsom yesterday.\u00a0 No \u201cNews-\u201d \u2014 you know, \u201cGovernor Newscum.\u201d\u00a0 What was that about?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I decided to be nice.\u00a0 It was nice that he came to the plane, honestly.\u00a0 You know, I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be at the plane.\u00a0 It was nice that he came to the plane.\u00a0\n\nAnd in the end, you know, we have the same goal.\u00a0 We want to make \u2014 take that catastrophe and make it as good as possible.\u00a0\n\nWe disagree in some things.\u00a0 I guess he\u2019s not so set on water, and I like water for putting out fires.\u00a0 I find it to be extremely good.\u00a0 Very \u2014 a little old fashioned, but about the best thing that God has ever created for putting out fires.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, we\u2019re going to be doing something on that.\u00a0 But no, I get along \u2014 I actually always got along with him well until fairly recently.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I could ask you about the first lady \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I very much \u2014 you know, I very much predicted that was going to happen.\u00a0 Because if you go back, like, six years, I said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t start getting this place taken care of and mitigating some of the problems that are here, you\u2019re going to end up with a fire like you had ever seen.\u201d\u00a0 I turned out to be right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I could ask you about the first lady.\u00a0 She seems to be taking a more public-facing role.\u00a0 I just wonder how you envision her spending the next four years.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think she was always very much involved, but you didn\u2019t see her \u2014 more behind the scenes.\u00a0 But she was always a \u201cfront of the scenes\u201d person, and I think she really wanted \u2014 she felt badly about North Carolina, and she felt very badly about California.\u00a0 Los Angeles \u2014 got a lot of friends.\u00a0 I have a lot of friends in North Carolina and \u2014 and both.\u00a0 And she has a lot of friends in California.\u00a0\n\nSo, she wanted to be with me for that.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 For both of them.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, is your preference for Larry Ellison to work to obtain TikTok?\u00a0 Or do you have any preference on how this deal is going?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken \u2014 Larry is a friend of mine.\u00a0 Lives in \u2014 you know, right in \u2014 near Mar-a-Lago, right down the road.\u00a0 I never spoke to Larry about TikTok.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But there is \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to many people about TikTok, and there\u2019s great interest in TikTok.\u00a0 And as you know, I have the right to sell it or close it, depending on what I think is best for the country.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019ll make a decision over the next 90 days or so.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a report, Mr. President, that says that you are putting together a deal with Oracle and outside investors to help them buy TikTok and save TikTok.\u00a0 Is that happening?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u00a0No, not with Oracle.\u00a0 With \u2014 numerous people are talking to me \u2014 very substantial people \u2014 about buying it.\u00a0 And I\u2019d make that decision over the next \u2014 probably over the next 30 days.\u00a0\n\nI have 90 days.\u00a0 Congress has given 90 days, and we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 If we could save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019ll make a decision.\u00a0 We have a lot of interest in it.\u00a0 And the United States will be a big beneficiary if we do it.\u00a0 I\u2019d only do it if the United States benefits.\u00a0\n\nI mean, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won on TikTok \u2014 and I ended up winning by a lot \u2014 young people.\u00a0 And as you know, Republicans historically \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 ever won young people, and I won them by a lot.\u00a0 So, I do have a little bit of a warm spot.\n\nBut, you know, it\u2019s a very popular site, and the kids are loving it, and some of the parents are loving it.\u00a0 And if we can save it, I think that would be a very good thing.\u00a0 And I think it would be economically good for America.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, could I ask you about Ukraine?\u00a0 Do you have any update on when you are going to talk to Russian president Vad- \u2014 Russian President Putin?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He wants to speak, and we\u2019ll be speaking soon.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve spoken to President Zelenskyy numerous times, and they\u2019d like to see peace.\u00a0 They would like to see an end to the war.\u00a0 And I think President Putin would like to see an end to the war too.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll see if we can help it along.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a shame.\u00a0 It\u2019s a war that would have never happened if I were president.\u00a0 It\u2019s a shame.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen a lot of people being fired from the federal government.\u00a0 What\u2019s the sort of criterion you\u2019re using for this?\u00a0 Is it loyalty to you?\u00a0 And can we expect more of these purges?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You have to show up to work, basically.\u00a0 You have to show up to work.\u00a0 You have to go to your office, and you have to work.\u00a0 And otherwise, you\u2019re not going to have a job.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you worry that that limits the pool of talent?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I think the talent is deep.\u00a0 We have very deep talent.\u00a0 But we also have a lot of excess people.\u00a0 You know, this was just a \u2014 this was a gimmick for Democrats, to a certain extent.\u00a0 But we have a lot of excess people, but the talent is very deep.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now that you\u2019ve done your first domestic trip, have you given any thought to where you want to go for your first international trip?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it could be Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 It could be UK.\u00a0 Traditionally, it\u2019s been UK.\u00a0\n\nLast time, I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy 450 billion dollars\u2019 worth of United States merchandise, including a lot of military equipment and farm equipment and other equipment.\u00a0 And if that offer were right, I\u2019d do that again.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you go to the UK, do you think you\u2019ll get along with Keir Starmer and the Labor government?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve met him already three times.\u00a0 He\u2019s come over to see me twice.\u00a0 I have a call \u2014 he and I have a call over the next 24 hours.\u00a0\n\nNo, I get along with him well.\u00a0 I like him a lot.\u00a0 He\u2019s liberal, which is a little bit different for me.\u00a0 But I think he\u2019s a very good person.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s done a very good job thus far.\u00a0 He\u2019s very new on the job, but he\u2019s represented his country in terms of his philosophy.\u00a0 I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve seen him twice.\u00a0 Had dinner with him at Trump Tower, as you probably know.\u00a0 You know that, right?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just on Saudi, Mr. President.\u00a0 You spoke to the crown prince.\u00a0 Did you discuss a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I discussed getting oil prices down. Because if you get oil prices down, Russia will stop the war, and Biden should have never allowed them to go up so high.\u00a0\n\nWhen Biden let them go up to that level, he was just inducing Russia, which sells oil, to go into a war.\u00a0 So, he should have never allowed \u2014 the Democrats, namely Biden, allowed oil prices to go up.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the reasons that you have the Ukraine catastrophe.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you bring the prices down?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Volume.\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) increasing production.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you tell us about your call with the king of Jordan today, please?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was a very good call.\u00a0 He\u2019s a friend of mine.\u00a0 I know him very well.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten along with him over the years very well, and he\u2019s done a wonderful job.\u00a0\n\nHe really houses, you know, millions of Palestinians, and he does it in a very humane way.\u00a0 And I compliment him on that.\u00a0 But he really \u2014 Jordan has done an amazing job of housing largely Palestin- \u2014 Palestinians.\u00a0 And he\u2019s done it in a very successful way.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, what was the subject of discussion?\u00a0 Was it \u2014 was it \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was that.\u00a0 I said to him, \u201cI\u2019d love you to take on more.\u201d\u00a0 Because I\u2019m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it\u2019s a mess.\u00a0 It\u2019s a real mess.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you\u2019d like Jordan to house people from Gaza?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You have to take people.\u00a0 I\u2019d like Egypt to take people.\u00a0 I\u2019m meeting with \u2014 I\u2019m talking to General el-Sisi tomorrow \u2014 sometime, I believe.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like Egypt to take people, and I\u2019d like Jordan to take people.\n\nI can \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 over the centuries, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s many, many conflicts, that site.\u00a0\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 It\u2019s something has to happen, but it\u2019s literally a demolition site right now.\u00a0 Almost everything is demolished, and people are dying there.\u00a0 So, I\u2019d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Temporary? \u00a0Or would they \u2014 would they ever go back?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It could be either.\u00a0 It could be temporarily, could be long term.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019ve spoken about artificial intelligence quite a bit this week.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any concerns about the risks to \u2014 to humanity about artificial superintelligence?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, look, artificial intelligence is the \u2014 it\u2019s where all of the smart countries want to be going.\u00a0 Great for coming up with cures to disease, great with coming up with everything, but there are always risks.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the first question I ask: How do you absolve yourself from (inaudible), et cetera?\u00a0 Because it could be the rabbit that gets away.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n\nBut it\u2019s going to be the biggest field \u2014 maybe the biggest field in the world, and we\u2019re going to be equipped to take it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re already leading.\u00a0 I mean, we\u2019re going to be leading.\u00a0 Very shortly, we\u2019re going to be leading by a lot.\u00a0\n\nWhat they do need is tremendous energy.\u00a0 They need electricity at levels that nobody has ever seen before, and we\u2019ll be able to supply that electric.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to use \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Pentagon \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll be using emergency power to give that electric.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Pentagon, Mr. President, just lifted a hold on 2,000-pound bombs for Israel, which was blocked by Biden.\u00a0 Can you \u2014 do you have a comment on that, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 On the what?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the 2,000-pound bombs \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that Biden had put a hold on.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We released them.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We released them today, and they\u2019ll have them, and they paid for them, and, you know, they\u2019ve been waiting for them for a long time.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been in storage for a long time.\u00a0\n\nBut we released them today to Israel.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did you do that, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because they bought them.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are reports, Mr. President, that you spoke to the Danish prime minister and she told you Greenland is not for sale.\u00a0 Will you take no for an answer on that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who are you with?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CNN.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Your favorite.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, they\u2019re terrible.\u00a0 Honestly, that\u2019s why they\u2019re going out of business.\u00a0 It\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 Or they\u2019ll be bought cheap.\u00a0 Maybe some rich guy will buy them cheap.\u00a0 But anyway, it\u2019s just the tone of your question every time.\n\nI think Greenland will be worked out with us.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to have it.\u00a0 And I think the people want to be with us, as you know.\u00a0 There\u2019s 55,000 people there.\u00a0 They want to be with us.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t know, really, what claim Denmark has to it, but it would be a very unfriendly act if they didn\u2019t allow that to happen.\u00a0 Because that\u2019s for protection of the free world.\u00a0 It\u2019s not for us; it\u2019s for the free world.\u00a0\n\nRight now, you have Russian ships.\u00a0 You have China ships.\u00a0 You have ships from various countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a good situation.\u00a0\n\nAnd I believe we\u2019ll get that.\u00a0 Yeah, I do believe it.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll get other things too that you\u2019re talking about, that nobody knows.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019ll get other \u2014 other things.\u00a0\n\nBut I do believe Greenland we\u2019ll get, because it really has to do with freedom of the world, not just freedom of \u2014 it has nothing to do with the United States, other than we\u2019re the one that can provide the freedom.\u00a0 They can\u2019t.\u00a0 They can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nI mean, they put two dog sleds there two weeks ago.\u00a0 They thought that was protection.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the other thing is Canada \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 The people don\u2019t like the way they\u2019ve been treated by Denmark.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like the way they\u2019ve been treated by Denmark.\u00a0 And they do like us.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on the Senate confirmations, Senat- \u2014 or Vice President JD Vance had to come and \u2014 to pass the tiebreaking vote.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re concerned at all about any of the other nominees.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Whatever it is, it is.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re doing well.\u00a0 I think we just had a big \u2014 a big win today, as you know.\u00a0 Kristi Noem, I think, will be outstanding at Homeland.\u00a0\n\nAnd we have some other ones going.\u00a0 And no, I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t see any major problems.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. \u2014 the U.S. has suspended most foreign aid, including PEPFAR, which is a program that\u2019s credited with saving millions of lives in Africa.\u00a0 Is there a timeline for opening up U.S. aid?\u00a0 Is there a review \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll see \u2014 we\u2019ll see about that.\u00a0 But we want other people to join us, because we\u2019re like a one-way street.\u00a0 So, we want other people to help us, and we want other people to join us.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re spending billions and billions and billions of dollars, and other countries that are wealthy are spending zero. And we want them to help.\u00a0 Why should we be the only one?\u00a0 So, they understand that.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been told that.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a little like NATO.\u00a0 I mean, we were spending \u2014 we were almost paying for all of NATO.\u00a0 And yet, they were taking advantage of us on trade.\u00a0 Similar countries.\u00a0 The same and similar countries.\u00a0\n\nAnd after I got involved, they were paying a lot of money on NATO.\u00a0 The Secretary General was very generous in his statements about me with respect to NATO.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I think NATO should be more too, though.\u00a0 I think it should be more than the two.\u00a0 It should be \u2014 should be five, actually.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The CIA, Mr. President, prefers to \u2014 prefers the lab leak theory to explain COVID\u2019s origins now.\u00a0 I was curious to hear your thoughts on that.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you have a good man there.\u00a0 A very good man.\u00a0 And John is \u2014 he\u2019s just gotten approved, as you know.\u00a0 John Ratcliffe also got approved.\u00a0 And I\u2019d rather have you ask him that question.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019ll be \u2014 he knows everything about it right now.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you had a chance \u2014 have you given any thought to the future of the air base at Diego Garcia, which, as you know, is part of the Chagos Islands, which Britain is returning to the Mauritius islands.\u00a0 There are concerns that could open it up to spying by Iran or China.\u00a0 Do you have \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I mean, it hasn\u2019t been number one on my list, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\u00a0 That was not number one.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) you didn\u2019t talk about Canada, about the Panama Canal.\u00a0 You mentioned today expansion \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think Canada has been treating us very unfairly on trade, and they\u2019ve taken advantage of us for years, and we\u2019re not going to allow that to happen.\u00a0\n\nI love Canada.\u00a0 I have so many friends up in Canada, and they like us and they like me.\u00a0 But Canada has been taking advantage of the United States for years, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.\n\nAnd without our subsidy, Canada, you know, doesn\u2019t exist really.\u00a0 It\u2019s very \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 Canada is totally reliant on us, therefore they should be a state.\u00a0 Canada \u2014 we lose $250 billion a year on Canada.\u00a0 I could stop that in one day.\u00a0 And if I stopped that, Canada wouldn\u2019t exist as a state, you know, as a \u2014 as a country.\n\nAnd I think if that\u2019s going to \u2014 if we\u2019re going to have to give that kind of subsidy \u2014 and we\u2019re not even talking about tariffs yet, but that\u2019ll happen on February 1st.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to lose $250 billion for the sake of supporting a country, it\u2019s not fair to us.\u00a0 And they do about almost 90 percent of their business with the United States, whereas with us, it\u2019s the opposite.\u00a0 It\u2019s, you know, relatively small.\u00a0\n\nSo, I don\u2019t want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on supporting a country unless that country is a state.\u00a0 And if it is a state, the people of Canada would pay a much lower tax.\u00a0 You know, their taxes would be cut in half.\u00a0 They would have no military problems.\u00a0 They\u2019d be much more secure in every way.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s a great thing for Canada.\u00a0 And I view it as, you know, honestly, a country that should be a state, and they\u2019ll get much better treatment, much better care, and much lower taxes, and they\u2019ll be much more secure.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for coming back.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3:27 P.M.
