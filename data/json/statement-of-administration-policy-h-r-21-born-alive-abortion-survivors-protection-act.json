Ann Wagner, R-MO-2, and 151 cosponsors)\n\nThe Administration strongly supports H.R. 21 the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and applauds the House for its efforts to protect the most vulnerable and prevent infanticide.\n\nCurrent law fails to provide adequate protections, including adequate requirements for the provision of medical care, for vulnerable newborns who survive an abortion attempt. If enacted, H.R. 21 would require any healthcare practitioner who is present at the time that such a child is born to exercise care to preserve the child\u2019s life and health, and to ensure the child is immediately transported and admitted to a hospital. The bill would also require a healthcare practitioner, or hospital employee, to immediately report a violation of these requirements. H.R. 21 would establish a civil right of action for, and prevent criminal prosecution and penalties from being brought against, the mothers of such children.\n\nAs President Trump established through Executive Order 13952 of September 25, 2020, it is the policy of the United States to recognize the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each child due protection under the law.\n\nA baby that survives an abortion and is born alive into this world should be treated just like any other baby born alive. H.R. 21 would properly amend current law to ensure that the life of one baby is not treated as being more or less valuable than another.\n\nIf H.R. 21 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he sign it into law.\n",
  "summary": "The **Statement of Administration Policy** supports **H.R. 21** - the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, introduced by **Rep. Ann Wagner** and co-sponsored by 151 others. The statement, dated **January 23, 2025**, is issued from the **Executive Office of the President** and highlights the Administration's strong support of the bill aimed at providing adequate protections for newborns who survive abortion attempts. If enacted, the act would mandate healthcare practitioners to preserve the life and health of such children and ensure they are transported to a hospital.\n\nThe bill also entails obligatory reporting by healthcare practitioners or hospital staff of any violations and allows civil legal action by the mothers without criminal penalties. The statement underscores President Trump's 2020 Executive Order affirming the dignity of newborns, asserting that all babies should be treated equally regardless of circumstances. The Administration indicates it would recommend the President sign this bill into law if passed in its current form.",
