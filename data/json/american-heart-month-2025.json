TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2025 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 7, 2025.\u00a0 I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join my Administration in recognizing and restating our pledge to fighting heart disease in all its forms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisthird day of February, in the year of our Lord two\u00a0thousand\u00a0twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United\u00a0States of\u00a0America the two\u00a0hundred and forty-ninth.THE WHITE HOUSE,\u00a0 \u00a0 February 3, 2025.\n",
