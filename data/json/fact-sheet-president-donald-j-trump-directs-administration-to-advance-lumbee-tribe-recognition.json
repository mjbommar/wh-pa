Trump Directs Administration to Advance Lumbee Tribe Recognition \t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 23, 2025\n\nDIRECTING PLAN FOR RECOGNITION OF LARGEST TRIBE EAST OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to advance full federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.\n    - The memorandum establishes that it is the policy of the United States to support federal recognition and full tribal benefits for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.\n    - It directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to assist the Lumbee Tribe in obtaining full federal recognition through legislation or other available mechanisms, including the right to receive full federal benefits. \u00a0\n\nFULL FEDERAL RECOGNITION IS LONG OVERDUE: The Lumbee have long been recognized at the state and federal level, but further federal action is required for full federal recognition and the accompanying benefits and protections.\n    - The State of North Carolina recognized the Lumbee Tribe in 1885, and in 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the 1956 Lumbee Act, which recognized the Lumbee but denied them some federal benefits.\n    - Tribes can gain federal recognition by: (1) Act of Congress; (2) the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Federal Acknowledgement process; or (3) federal court decision.       - President Trump\u2019s memorandum directs the Secretary of the Interior to analyze these legal pathways for advancing Lumbee recognition. \n    - Federal recognition grants tribes\u2019 certain governmental autonomy, land protections, and access to federal programs and services, like health care through the Indian Health Service.\n\nDELIVERING ON PROMISE TO SUPPORT RECOGNITION: President Trump promised to support federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nOn September 23, 2024, President Trump stated: \u201cToday, I\u2019m officially announcing that, if I am elected in November, I will sign legislation granting the great Lumbee Tribe federal recognition that it deserves.\u201d\n",
  "summary": "President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum on January 23, 2025, directing the Secretary of the Interior to devise a plan to advance the federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. This action underscores the United States' policy to support tribal recognition and benefits. The memorandum necessitates that the Interior Secretary explores legal avenues, such as congressional action or other mechanisms, to achieve full recognition and access to federal benefits for the tribe.\n\nThe Lumbee Tribe has a history of partial recognition, being acknowledged by North Carolina since 1885 and through the 1956 Lumbee Act signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, which denied some federal benefits. The federal recognition process can occur through congressional acts, Interior Department processes, or court decisions. The President's directive aims at ensuring the tribe receives governmental autonomy, land protections, and access to federal programs like those provided by the Indian Health Service, addressing a long-standing promise to support the Lumbee Tribe.",
