the use of sex hormones, such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, to align an individual\u2019s physical appearance with an identity that differs from his or her sex; and surgical procedures that attempt to transform an individual\u2019s physical appearance to align with an identity that differs from his or her sex or that attempt to alter or remove an individual\u2019s sexual organs to minimize or destroy their natural biological functions. \u00a0This phrase sometimes is referred to as \u201cgender affirming care.\u201d\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Ending Reliance on Junk Science. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The blatant harm done to children by chemical and surgical mutilation cloaks itself in medical necessity, spurred by guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which lacks scientific integrity. \u00a0In light of the scientific concerns with the WPATH guidance:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0agencies shall rescind or amend all policies that rely on WPATH guidance, including WPATH\u2019s \u201cStandards of Care Version 8\u201d; and\u00a0\n\n(ii) \u00a0within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall publish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Defunding Chemical and Surgical Mutilation. \u00a0The head of each executive department or agency (agency) that provides research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, shall, consistent with applicable law and in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Additional Directives to the Secretary of HHS. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary of HHS shall, consistent with applicable law, take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children, including regulatory and sub-regulatory actions, which may involve the following laws, programs, issues, or documents:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0clinical-abuse or inappropriate-use assessments relevant to State Medicaid programs;\n\n(iii) \u00a0mandatory drug use reviews;\n\n(iv) \u00a0\u00a0section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;\n\n(v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0quality, safety, and oversight memoranda;\n\n(vi) \u00a0\u00a0essential health benefits requirements; and\n\n(vii) \u00a0the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and other federally funded manuals, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary of HHS shall promptly withdraw HHS\u2019s March 2, 2022, guidance document titled \u201cHHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy\u201d and, in consultation with the Attorney General, issue new guidance protecting whistleblowers who take action related to ensuring compliance with this order.\n\nSec. 6. \u00a0TRICARE. \u00a0The Department of Defense provides health insurance, through TRICARE, to nearly 2 million individuals under the age of 18. \u00a0As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Secretary of Defense shall commence a rulemaking or sub-regulatory action to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children from TRICARE coverage and amend the TRICARE provider handbook to exclude chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0Requirements for Insurance Carriers. \u00a0The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall:\n\n(a) \u00a0include provisions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) programs call letter for the 2026 Plan Year specifying that eligible carriers, including the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, will exclude coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries or hormone treatments; and\n\n(b) \u00a0negotiate to obtain appropriate corresponding reductions in FEHB and PSHB premiums.\n\nSec. 8. \u00a0Directives to the Department of Justice.\u00a0 The Attorney General shall:\n\n(a) \u00a0review Department of Justice enforcement of section 116 of title 18, United States Code, and prioritize enforcement of protections against female genital mutilation;\n\n(b)\u00a0convene States\u2019 Attorneys General and other law enforcement officers to coordinate the enforcement of laws against female genital mutilation across all American States and Territories;\u00a0\n\n(c) \u00a0prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation;\n\n(d) \u00a0in consultation with the Congress, work to draft, propose, and promote legislation to enact a private right of action for children and the parents of children whose healthy body parts have been damaged by medical professionals practicing chemical and surgical mutilation, which should include a lengthy statute of limitations; and\n\n(e) \u00a0prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end child-abusive practices by so-called sanctuary States that facilitate stripping custody from parents who support the healthy development of their own children, including by considering the application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and recognized constitutional rights.\n\nSec. 9. \u00a0Enforcing Adequate Progress. \u00a0Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order shall submit a single, combined report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, detailing progress in implementing this order and a timeline for future action.\u00a0 The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall regularly convene the heads of agencies with responsibilities under this order (or their designees) to coordinate and prepare for this submission.\n\nSec. 10.\u00a0 Severability.\u00a0 If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of any of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\nSec. 11. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 28, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On January 28, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order aimed at ending the practice of what is referred to as 'chemical and surgical mutilation' of children. This includes the use of puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries for transitioning minors under 19 years of age. The order mandates that no federal funding is to be used to support these practices. It also directs various government agencies to review and amend existing policies, guidance, and grants related to gender transition treatments for children.\n\nThe order includes instructions to rescind guidance that relies on standards from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which the order claims lacks scientific integrity. Instead, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must review existing literature on gender dysphoria best practices and improve the quality of data concerning minors with gender identity issues. Additionally, the order calls for revising insurance coverages under Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Federal Employee Health Benefits to exclude coverage for these procedures.\n\nAgencies like the Department of Justice are tasked with prioritizing enforcement against practices like female genital mutilation and ensuring consumer protection against misleading claims on gender transition interventions. The order also highlights legal strategies to protect children and support parents who oppose gender transition interventions for their child. Agencies must report progress on these directives within 60 days to facilitate coordinated government action.",
