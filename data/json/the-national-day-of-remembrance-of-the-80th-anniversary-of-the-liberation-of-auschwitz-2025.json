TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 27, 2025, as a National Day of Remembrance of the 80th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz. \u00a0On this day, I call upon every American citizen to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and prayers commemorating the victims of the Holocaust and honoring the sacrifices of the men and women who helped liberate the victims of the Nazis at Auschwitz.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thistwenty-seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord two\u00a0thousand\u00a0twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United\u00a0States of\u00a0America the two\u00a0hundred and forty-ninth.\n",
