EST\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little cold outside, but you\u2019re getting used to the cold.And one of the things that are very important to me and one of the reasons I\u2019m happy that we won so convincingly is to help North Carolina get fixed up.\u00a0 They supported us in record numbers, and I\u2019m supporting them in record numbers too.\n\nAnd they had me set \u2014 I wanted to go to Los Angeles and see what was going on with California, why they aren\u2019t releasing the water.\u00a0 Millions and millions of gallons of water, they\u2019re sending it out to the Pacific.\u00a0 Someday, somebody\u2019s going \u2014 going to explain that one.\u00a0 In the meantime, they have no water in Los Angeles, where they had the problems.But \u2014 so, we\u2019re going there.\u00a0 But I said, \u201cWell, what about North Carolina?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, you could do that la-\u201d \u2014 \u201cno, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWe\u2019re stopping in North Carolina first, and then we\u2019re going to Los Angeles.\u201dAnd we just appreciate the outpouring of love that we\u2019ve had here.\u00a0Lara was, as you know, very instrumental in the campaign, and she lived here and is loved, and we appreciate it.\u00a0And Michael Whatley has been incredible \u2014 wherever Michael is \u2014 hello, Michael.\u00a0 Michael Whatley has been great.\u00a0And your congressmen have been great.\u00a0And what we thought we\u2019d do is take a quick look around.\u00a0 First, we wanted to do this.\u00a0I \u2014 I want to say that we\u2019re very disappointed in FEMA.\u00a0 Your new governor, it\u2019s not his fault.\u00a0 He\u2019s brand-new to the whole situation.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to work together with the governor.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to work together with the \u2014 your senators, but, really, we\u2019re going to work a lot with your congressman, especially the three that are in the area, and Michael Whatley.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to put Michael in charge of making sure everything goes well.\u00a0And Franklin Graham has been unbelievable.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made a big contribution to Franklin, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.\u00a0 But I \u2014 I\u2019ve been hearing nothing but praise for the job that Samaritan\u2019s Purse has done with Franklin, and we appreciate it.\u00a0Where is Franklin?\u00a0 He\u2019s around here someplace.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And \u2014 that good-looking guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s always been a good-looking guy.\u00a0His father was a good-looking guy, too, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 We loved his father, right?\u00a0 I saw his father in the latter years, and I said, \u201cWell, he \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have long to go.\u201d\u00a0 He was having a hard time, and he lived about three, four years after that, right?\u00a0REVEREND GRAHAM:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He \u2014 he was \u2014 they call \u2014 they say he was \u201cgood stock.\u201d\u00a0 He had the ultimate good stock.\u00a0But I want to thank you, Franklin.\u00a0 You were \u2014 you\u2019ve been fantastic here.\u00a0 And everywhere he goes, he \u2014 he\u2019s always \u2014 he\u2019s always the first one I see.\u00a0Does \u2014 people don\u2019t realize it, how \u2014 how good it is.\u00a0 A lot of people, they go, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s for the people that he\u2019s got.\u201d\u00a0 And you guys know, because you\u2019re here, but the people that he\u2019s got have done amazing work.\u00a0So, I just want to thank everybody.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get over and take a look.\u00a0 We\u2019ll say a few words.\u00a0 I want to just \u2014 I do want to introduce some of the people that we have.\u00a0And our first lady \u2014 we\u2019ll start with our first lady.\u00a0 She wanted to be here because of North Carolina.\u00a0 And then I said, \u201cWell, you can do that, but you\u2019re going to have to come to California too.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0THE FIRST LADY:\u00a0 That\u2019s okay.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And she said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)And we got to fix that one up too.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 who \u2014 do you ever see anything like that one?\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 who would have \u2014 who would have thought that could have happened.\u00a0So, Governor Josh Stein, thank you very much.\u00a0 We appreciate it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have a \u2014 a very long and good relationship.\u00a0Representatives \u2014 maybe stand up, if you would, so we \u2014 the press can see.\u00a0 Representatives Chuck Edwards \u2014 Chuck, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Chuck.\u00a0 Tim Moore.\u00a0 Virginia.\u00a0 You know Virginia Foxx, a legend \u2014 she is such a powerful woman.\u00a0 Pat Harrigan.\u00a0 Pat, thank you very much.\u00a0Your agriculture commissioner, who I hear is excellent, Steve Troxler \u2014 Steve, thank you very much.\u00a0 Good job, Steve.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got plenty to do, right?MR. TROXLER:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 More than you ever thought.\u00a0North Carolina Speaker Destin Hall.\u00a0 Thank you, Destin.\u00a0 Thanks, Destin.\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0House Majority Leader Brenden Jones.\u00a0 Brenden, thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019re making progress, Brenden.\u00a0State Representatives Dudley Greene, Karl Gillespie, thank you very much, fellas.\u00a0 Good, good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0State Senators Kevin Corbin, Warren Daniel, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Kevin, Warren.\u00a0And County Commissioner Jennifer Best, thank you.\u00a0 Jennifer, thank you.So, Hurricane Helene was one of the worst natural disasters in American history.\u00a0 It was far worse than it was even billed.\u00a0 I have never seen such water damage.\u00a0 It was largely water damage \u2014 wind damage, but water damage nobody has ever seen.\u00a0I\u2019ve been here, as you know, numerous times, but now I\u2019m here in a position where we can do something, meaning I\u2019ve been in \u2014 in office for four days.\u00a0 And I wanted to come sooner, but actually, they had a little problem with getting, logistically, in here, but I would have been ev- \u2014 here even sooner.One oh four \u2014 a hundred and four North Carolinians have \u2014 at least \u2014 have lost their lives.\u00a0 Is that now a fairly firm number, or are they still finding people?\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 Is \u2014 what do you think?\u00a0 They\u2019re still finding people?\u00a0 Pretty much, okay?\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of people.\u00a0A hundred and four people lost their lives.\u00a0 Seventy-three thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed.\u00a0And I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve been to a lot of them, and this was a \u2014 this was like lots of hurricanes in one.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen such damage done by water.\u00a0 And the \u2014 the water came, it was violent, and it left, and there was, like, nothing left.\u00a0 It\u2019s really pretty amazing.\u00a0At one point, half of the emergency calls to FEMA went unanswered.\u00a0 That\u2019s real bad.\u00a0 FEMA was not doing their job.\u00a0 The city of Asheville went without running water for two months.\u00a0A whistleblower testified that some FEMA employees refused to help people who displayed Trump signs on their properties.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 I read that.\u00a0 That\u2019s not nice.\u00a0 That\u2019s not too nice, is it?But whoever those property people were, thank you very much.\u00a0Michael, is that true?MR. WHATLEY:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s not good \u2014 huh? \u2014 about the property owners.\u00a0 You put a Trump sign on it, they wouldn\u2019t help \u2014 FEMA.\u00a0Earlier this year, FEMA kicked 2,000 North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into below-freezing temperatures.\u00a0 What was that all about?\u00a0 Is that \u2014 do you know about that?\u00a0 What happened?\u00a0 Tell me.STATE SPEAKER HALL:\u00a0 We had an incompetent administration under Biden.\u00a0 And we had a disaster, and then we call it \u201cthe disaster after the disaster\u201d \u2014 that was the FEMA response.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You had nothing but disaster since then.\u00a0 I \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter at this point.\u00a0 Biden did a bad job.\u00a0Some residents still don\u2019t have hot water, drinking water, or anything else.\u00a0 And m- \u2014 many of them don\u2019t have quarters.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have anything.\u00a0 They got a stipend for what they lost, and we\u2019re going to take care of it.\u00a0This is totally unacceptable, and I\u2019ll be taking strong action to get North Carolina the support that you need to quickly recover and rebuild.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on it very hard.And I think if Michael Whatley does half as good a job for North Carolina as he did for my campaign, we\u2019ll be very happy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Him and Lara were a very powerful team.\u00a0So, you think you can handle it, Michael?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure, Michael.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I think this is maybe, in many ways, easier.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Maybe easier.\u00a0 But you\u2019re going to lead the team.\u00a0Do you want to say who the \u2014 who the congressmen are that you want to appoint?\u00a0 Do you want to introduce them?MR. WHATLEY:\u00a0 So, we \u2014 we have Virginia Foxx and Chuck Edwards and Tim Moore \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And \u2014MR. WHATLEY:\u00a0 \u2014 whose districts encompass the area (inaudible) \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they are the districts that were most severely impacted, right?\u00a0 You were \u2014 you were affected, then, Virginia?REPRESENTATIVE FOXX:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0 Lost my own property.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Really?\u00a0Well, I\u2019ll also be signing an executive order to begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA or maybe getting rid of FEMA.\u00a0 I think, frankly, FEMA is not good.\u00a0I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to go and \u2014 whether it\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican governor, you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling FEMA.\u00a0 And then FEMA gets here, and they don\u2019t know the area, they\u2019ve never been to the area, and they want to give you rules that you\u2019ve never heard about, they want to bring people that aren\u2019t as good as the people you already have.\u00a0And FEMA has turned out to be a \u2014 a disaster.\u00a0 And you could go back a long way.\u00a0 You could go back to Louisiana.\u00a0 You could go back to some of the things that took place in Texas.\u00a0 It \u2014 it turns out to be the state that ends up doing the work.\u00a0 It just complicates it.\u00a0I think we\u2019re going to recommend that FEMA go away and we pay directly \u2014 we pay a percentage to the state.\u00a0 But the state should fix this.\u00a0 If the state did this from the beginning, it would have been a lot better situation.\u00a0I think you guys agree with that, right?So, I just want to tell that Ash- \u2014 say that Asheville \u2014 I know it well.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great place, and we\u2019re going to have it be a great place again.\u00a0 That was the one that was most severely affected.\u00a0 But North Carolina is going to come back bigger, better, stronger than ever before, and you\u2019re going to be very thankful.\u00a0And you\u2019ve already seen \u2014 I know that it really began four days ago, but you\u2019ve already seen more action than you have in the last three months.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to get it together.\u00a0We\u2019re informing the Army Corps of Engineers to get going, because you have a lot of river breaks and a lot of areas that you\u2019re going to need some pretty big work.\u00a0 And they\u2019re on their way.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to be working very \u2014 much harder than they\u2019ve been working in the past.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to take care of it.\u00a0Any questions from the press of any of the congressmen, governor, anybody?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, are you going to sign an executive order on FEMA \u2014 getting rid of it?\u00a0 Can you explain more about signing the executive order to get rid of FEMA, please?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 FEMA has been a very big disappointment.\u00a0 They cost a tremendous amount of money.\u00a0 It\u2019s very bureaucratic, and it\u2019s very slow.\u00a0Other than that, we\u2019re very happy with them.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Laughter.)And I think it\u2019s \u2014 I think when there\u2019s a \u2014 when there\u2019s a problem with the state, I think that that problem should be taken care of by the state.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we have states for; they take care of problems.\u00a0 And a governor can handle something very quickly.You know, one of the things I\u2019ve noticed, because I\u2019ve been doing this for a while, and we had a pretty good FEMA.\u00a0 But I also noticed that when they come, they end up in arguments of \u2014 they\u2019re fighting all the time over who does what.\u00a0 It\u2019s a \u2014 just a \u2014 it\u2019s just not a good system.This system is so beautifully designed over 250 years, approximately, you know, and we\u2019ll soon be celebrating the 250th year.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a very big celebration.\u00a0 But it\u2019s been designed very well, and we\u2019re going to leave it that way.When North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, when \u2014 everybody knows the governor of Tennessee, I think \u2014 everybody.\u00a0 Do you \u2014 do you know everybody here, pretty much?\u00a0 He\u2019s o- \u2014GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 I \u2014 I\u2019ve introduced myself.\u00a0\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I never thought of it, but you\u2019re right over the ridge, right?GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 Right over the hi- \u2014 right over the hillside.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So \u2014 so, you\u2019re here to help.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 These here, thi- \u2014 the people in this region, including Tennessee \u2014 the people of Appalachia are grateful that you are here and that you haven\u2019t forgotten them.\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 And that there are other disasters, but this one was enormous for both North Carolina and Tennessee.\u00a0 So, thank you.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of disasters, and this \u2014 when I came \u2014 I came here right after, the day after.\u00a0 And when I came here, I couldn\u2019t believe it, actually.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe the damage.\u00a0 I \u2014 and I\u2019ve seen a lot of them.\u00a0 This was \u2014 this was more like a tornado than it was \u2014 what we witnessed.\u00a0So, we\u2019re going to get it very much \u2014 very much taken care of.\u00a0 Good job.\u00a0 That\u2019s nice that you came.GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And so, you call it right \u2014 you\u2019re right over the ridge, right?\u00a0 Tennessee.GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 Right over the ridge, yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I like Tennessee, too.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see.\u00a0 Where did I get more votes \u2014 Tennessee or North Carolina?\u00a0 I hate \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I hate to tell you, North Carolina, it was Tennessee.\u00a0GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 There\u2019s one of the counties in this disaster that had 88 percent for you.\u00a0 So (inaudible) \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Eighty-eight percent, yeah?\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 the people are just incredible people.GOVERNOR LEE:\u00a0 Yeah.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, do you have any questions, press?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, Mr. President, you talked about conditions being placed on aid to California \u2014 voter ID and the like.\u00a0 Are there any conditions that you\u2019re going to put on aid to North Carolina?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, we\u2019re going to do a lot for North Carolina.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019ve been very slow.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s been so bad.\u00a0 This has been one of the worst I\u2019ve seen.\u00a0Katrina, of course, you know, was somebo- \u2014 something that \u2014 obviously, that was a long time ago \u2014 that was not good.\u00a0 But this has been very slow.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if that was for political reasons because they lost the state.\u00a0 You know, Biden lost the state.\u00a0 Maybe he felt \u2014 he doesn\u2019t care.\u00a0 Maybe there were other reasons.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.But this has been very slow.\u00a0 By any standard, this has been very slow.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to make up for lost time.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But no conditions you\u2019re going to push for aid, just full stop?THE PRESIDENT: \u00a0Well, in California, I have a condition.\u00a0 In California, we want them to have voter ID so the people have a voice, because right now, the people don\u2019t have a voice because you don\u2019t know who\u2019s voting and it\u2019s very corrupt.\u00a0And we also want them to release the water.\u00a0 If they release the water, they wouldn\u2019t have had a problem.\u00a0 If they released the water when I told them to \u2014 because I told them to do it seven years ago \u2014 if they would have done it, you wouldn\u2019t have had the problem that you had.\u00a0 You might have \u2014 you might not have even had a fire.So \u2014 but here, I don\u2019t have that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a different thing.\u00a0 You got hit by a storm.\u00a0 The people are incredible.\u00a0 They worked really well.\u00a0 Franklin was fantastic, and other groups \u2014 by the way, other groups came in that were also fantastic.\u00a0 And other states came in; Tennessee and a couple of others came in, and they really helped.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.No, this is a different kind of a thing.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief in North Carolina?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 About what?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you decided how much funding you would allocate for disaster relief?THE PRESIDENT: \u00a0I haven\u2019t de- \u2014 I have to see what it is.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are \u2014 are \u2014 are you disappointed that Senator Schiff hasn\u2019t joined you on this trip?\u00a0 It\u2019s reported that you invited Senator Schiff to join you on this trip, and he was too busy.\u00a0 Are you disappointed by that?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I was told that Schiff was going to travel with us to California.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t thrilled, to be honest with you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0And I saw him last night on television.\u00a0 It looks like he got hit with a baseball bat or something.\u00a0 What happened to him?\u00a0 Something happened to him.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you still \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was a little \u2014 it looked like he got hit.\u00a0 It looked like he got beat around, but \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, did \u2014 did you invite him or \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But I\u2019ll ask Karoline to find out what happened to him.\u00a0No, if he wanted to come out, I would have done that.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I \u2014 somebody said that he wanted to come on the plane, but I think he\u2019s staying back for the votes.\u00a0 There\u2019s some pretty good votes going on.Yeah.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what is your timeline for getting rid of FEMA?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 I woul- \u2014 for the \u2014 for this one?\u00a0 For this one?\u00a0 Well \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For \u2014 you just talked about possibly getting rid of FEMA.\u00a0 What timeline are you looking at, and how would you do that?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re looking here \u2014 here, you\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 To start \u2014 we\u2019re going to start immediately \u2014 timeline. \u00a0And to finish, it\u2019s going to be a period of time.\u00a0You know, people are also rebuilding their houses.\u00a0 How long does it take to build a house, right?\u00a0 It takes a time.And I want them to build houses bigger, better, nicer than they had before, so they can have \u2014 at least they get something out of this disaster.\u00a0 This was a real disaster.No, timeline will be fast.\u00a0 In terms of infrastructure, I think very fast.\u00a0I want to thank Elon, because Elon was able to get us communication systems, as you know \u2014 Starlink.\u00a0 We had no communication.\u00a0 The first day I got here, I was asked by one of the people, one of the really great representatives, professionals that \u2014 \u201cIs there any way you could get Starlink here,\u201d because they had no communication whatsoever.\u00a0 And I called up Elon Musk, and he had, you know, hundreds of units brought here \u2014 like, brought immediately.\u00a0 And it\u2019s hard to get; they couldn\u2019t get them before.\u00a0 And that made a lot of difference.\u00a0 I think it saved a lot of lives, actually.Yeah.\u00a0Infrastructure-wise, we\u2019ll do it quickly.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, can you just talk about how long you might \u2014 do you think it might take to get rid of FEMA?\u00a0 What\u2019s the timeline on that if you\u2019re going to roll it back?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I would say, look, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m not really thinking about FEMA right now here.\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking about Michael Whatley, and I\u2019m thinking about the three congresspeople that you just heard from and also the other people in Congress.\u00a0 And they\u2019ll be working with the governor.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be working with the governor.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s what I see.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change of subject real quickly.\u00a0 The Laken Riley Act was signed by Mike \u2014 Speaker Johnson yesterday.\u00a0 When do you \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 when do you anticipate to put \u2014 to sign that in the Oval Office?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re honored by that.\u00a0 Laken Riley \u2014 I was there at the time, and we had a big meeting with the parents right after that horrible thing took place.\u00a0And we have a \u2014 an act.\u00a0 You all know what that act represents.\u00a0 And it was a bipartisan bill.\u00a0 Many Democrats signed \u2014 signed on to it.\u00a0 That\u2019s something that is a tribute to Laken, a beautiful young lady who was killed viciously by an illegal alien.\u00a0 And we passed a very powerful bill, and it was just approved.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have a ceremony sometime very shortly.I\u2019ll be signing it.\u00a0 In other words, if you\u2019re asking, I will definitely be signing it.\u00a0 Okay?Yeah.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, and I\u2019m wondering if you have any comment on that?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 About what?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The security detail for Anthony Fauci was terminated last night, sir.\u00a0 Do you have a comment?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I think, you know, when you work for govern- \u2014 government, at some point, your security detail comes off.\u00a0 And, you know, you can\u2019t have them forever.\u00a0 So, I think it\u2019s very standard.\u00a0 If it would be for somebody else, you wouldn\u2019t be asking the question.\u00a0The question is very fair, but, you know, you work for government \u2014 we took some off other people too \u2014 but you can\u2019t have a security detail for the rest of your life because you worked for government.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you ask for it to be taken off, sir?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see what happens.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you feel partially responsible if something were to happen to, say, Dr. Fauci \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 or John Bolton?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0You know, they all made a lot of money.\u00a0 They can hire their own security too.\u00a0 All the people you\u2019re talking about, they can go out \u2014 I can give them some good numbers of very good security people.\u00a0 They can hire their own security.\u00a0 They all made a lot of money.\u00a0 Fauci made a lot of money.\u00a0 They all did.\u00a0So, if they, you know, felt that strongly, I \u2014 I think that \u2014 certainly, I would not take responsibility.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 North Carolina is a state that relies on trade and manufacturing.\u00a0 Are you going to have an announcement on new tariffs coming soon?\u00a0 Is there a timeline now?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, the tariffs are going to make our country rich.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be a rich, rich country very soon.\u00a0 Tariffs are going to make it rich.\u00a0 And competence \u2014 we have common sense, competence, and tariffs.\u00a0The word \u201ctariff\u201d is one of the most beautiful words in the dictionary.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jonathan Reynolds, the \u2014 the business secretary of the United Kingdom, said that there\u2019s an even trade between the U.S. and \u2014 and the UK, so they shouldn\u2019t have tariffs.\u00a0 Does trade imbalances or a balanced trade affect tariffs and your decisions?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, ba- \u2014 unbalance and balance, and also deficits, like with Canada.\u00a0 We lose $200 billion a year with Canada.\u00a0 That\u2019s because we allow them to make cars.\u00a0 We allow them to take lumber.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their cars.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their lumber.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their food products because we make the same products right on the other side of the border.\u00a0 It\u2019s sort of crazy.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ve just allowed that \u2014 you know, bad management has allowed it, over the last four years, in particular, to become very imbalanced.\u00a0And I said to \u2014 I call him \u201cGovernor Trudeau,\u201d but he\u2019s Prime Minister Trudeau \u2014 when he was prime minister, I asked him, \u201cWhy would we do that?\u00a0 Why?\u201d\u00a0 And he was unable to give me an answer.\u00a0 He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s fair that we\u2019re paying $200 billion to keep Canada going?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAnd what would happen\u201d \u2014 I said \u2014 I asked him, \u201cWhat would happen if we didn\u2019t do that, if we didn\u2019t subsidize Canada?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWe\u2019d be a failed nation.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cThen you should be a state,\u201d because why are we paying all of that money to Canada when, you know, we \u2014 we could use it ourselves, right?So, we take care of their military.\u00a0 You know, we ordered \u2014 we\u2019re going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers.\u00a0 Big ones.\u00a0 And all of a sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal.\u00a0 I say, \u201cWhy are we doing that?\u201dI mean, I like doing that if they\u2019re a state, but I don\u2019t like doing that if they\u2019re a nation.Also, they\u2019ve been very nasty to us on trade.\u00a0 Historically, Canada has been very, very bad to us, very unfair to us on trade.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll see how it all works out.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, the United Kingdom \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I would \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 might be in a better spot?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I would love to see Canada be the 51st state.\u00a0 The Canadian citizens, if that happened, would get a very big tax cut \u2014 tremendous tax cut \u2014 because they\u2019re very high- \u2014 highly taxed.\u00a0 And you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about military.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about many of the things.\u00a0 You\u2019d have better health coverage.\u00a0 You\u2019d have much better health coverage.\u00a0So, I think the people of Canada would like it, you know, if it\u2019s explained. \u00a0But I \u2014 just to start off, they\u2019d have a very \u2014 they\u2019d have a massive tax cut, and they\u2019d have a lot more business, because then we\u2019d let business go to Canada routinely.\u00a0 And there\u2019d be no tariffs.\u00a0 You know, if we did that, there\u2019d be no tariffs.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, the United Kingdom might be in a better spot, then?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you talk about Samaritan\u2019s Purse?\u00a0 Reverend Franklin Graham has been a great asset to this state.\u00a0 Talk a little bit about the way the Samaritan Purse has helped North Carolinians.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, say it once again.\u00a0 The first \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverend Franklin Graham has been a big part of Samaritan Purse and their aid to North Carolina.\u00a0 I just want to get your thoughts on that.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, Franklin Graham has been a big asset to the state.\u00a0 His father was a big asset to the state, to the country \u2014 both of them.\u00a0 I just think this: I think Franklin and \u2014 and other people that are doing what Franklin have done \u2014 but I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve known Franklin so long.\u00a0 He was at the inauguration.\u00a0 He made a speech, beautiful speech; beautiful prayer.\u00a0 He just \u2014 he does a great job.\u00a0And we gave \u2014 we made a big donation, and it was \u2014 it was money well spent.\u00a0 Sometimes you make donations, it\u2019s not well spent.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a great job here.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a really great job.So, I want to thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to the site now, and \u2014 one of the sites \u2014 and we\u2019ll \u2014 I think you\u2019ll \u2014 for those that haven\u2019t seen it, you won\u2019t even believe it, but not enough work was done.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get it done fast.\u00a0And I can speak for the Republican congressmen, we\u2019re going to knock it out, right?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to knock it out.\u00a0 And I think we take it very personally, because it was \u2014 North Carolina was very unfairly treated \u2014 very, very unfairly treated.\u00a0 And it was obvious.\u00a0 It was too obvious.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to make up for lost time.\u00a0So, thank you to the people of North Carolina.\u00a0\n\nThank you, everybody.\n\nEND \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
