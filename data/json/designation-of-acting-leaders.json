  "summary": "# Summary\n\nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump announced appointments to acting cabinet and cabinet-level positions. This proclamation was made in accordance with the United States Constitution and specific federal laws, notably 5 U.S.C. 3345 and others. These appointments ensure that essential government roles continue to operate until permanent appointments are made.\n\nThe directive, issued from the White House, signifies an important administrative action to maintain continuity within the presidential administration. By naming individuals to serve in these capacities temporarily, the administration can avoid disruptions in government operations and decision-making processes as it transitions to new leadership.",
