  "summary": "On February 10, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to terminate the use of paper straws by the federal government. This decision stems from concerns that paper straws, often replacing plastic ones due to environmental campaigns, are less functional, potentially harmful due to their chemical composition, more costly, and sometimes involve plastic in their packaging. Hence, it is the policy of the U.S. government to end the usage of paper straws.\n\nThe order mandates that all executive departments and agencies take necessary actions to stop procuring paper straws and ensure they are no longer supplied in federal buildings. Moreover, it calls for the disbandment of policies disfavouring plastic straws that were influenced by a previous executive order, which was revoked in January 2025. A National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws is to be developed within 45 days, focusing on eliminating internal policies against plastic straws, addressing states' and entities' contract policies penalizing plastic straw usage, and utilizing all possible tools to enforce the new directive across the nation.\n\nLastly, the order clarifies that it does not affect any existing legal authorities or create any enforceable rights, and it must be carried out according to applicable laws and subject to budgetary considerations.",
