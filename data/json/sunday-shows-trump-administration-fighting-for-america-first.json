But the president is crystal clear\u2026 he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.\u201d\n    - On President Trump\u2019s desire for peace : \u201cShouldn\u2019t we all be happy that we have a president who\u2019s trying to stop wars and prevent them instead of start them? And I just don\u2019t get it. I really don\u2019t, other than the fact that it\u2019s Donald J. Trump. If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he\u2019s on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize. This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians. And \u2013 and that \u2013 that is the point the president has made.\u201d\n\n**National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on State of the Union**\n    - On the Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Zelenskyy : \u201cIt was not clear Zelenskyy was going to go to negotiations at all \u2014 that he would ever be able to negotiate with Putin and whether he shared our goal of ending this war\u2026 This was a huge missed opportunity for him and for his country.\u201d\n\n**Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on Sunday Morning Futures**\n    - On President Trump delivering results : \u201cWe\u2019ve had the lowest crossings ever, ever, under Donald Trump because of his ability to negotiate with Canada and Mexico.\u201d\n\n**Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Fox News Sunday**\n    - On the danger of continuing the war in Ukraine:  \u201cThe longer this goes on, not only are more Ukrainians losing their lives, but it increases the potential of this escalation towards World War III \u2026 That\u2019s not a cost that President Trump is willing to accept.\u201d\n\n**Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Face the Nation**\n    - On rebuilding the economy : \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s been in office five weeks\u2026 interest rates \u2014 the 10-year bond\u2026 have been down every week since President Trump was President. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So, that\u2019s a pretty good start.\u201d\n\n**Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Media Buzz**\n    - On cameras being able to witness President Trump\u2019s Oval Office meeting with Ukraine : \u201cPresident Trump is the most transparent president in history. And as he said, it was great for the cameras to be in there because the American people \u2014 and the world \u2014 were able to see what the president and his team have seen behind the scenes in negotiating with President Zelenskyy\u2019s team. They have continually denied the pragmatic reality of where their country stands today.\u201d\n",
