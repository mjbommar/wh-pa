health plans to post their negotiated rates with providers as well as their out-of-network payments to providers and the actual prices they or their pharmacy benefit manager pay for prescription drugs; and health plans to maintain a consumer-facing internet tool through which individuals can access price information.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One economic analysis from 2023 estimated the impact of these regulations, if fully implemented, could result in as much as $80 billion in healthcare savings for consumers, employers, and insurers by 2025. \u00a0Another report from 2024 suggested healthcare price transparency could help employers reduce healthcare costs by 27 percent across 500 common healthcare services. \u00a0Recent data has found the top 25 percent of most expensive healthcare service prices have dropped by 6.3 percent per year following the initial implementation of price transparency during my first term. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, progress on price transparency at the Federal level has stalled since the end of my first term. \u00a0Hospitals and health plans were not adequately held to account when their price transparency data was incomplete or not even posted at all. \u00a0The Biden Administration failed to take sufficient steps to fully enforce my Administration\u2019s requirement that would end the opaque nature of drug prices by ensuring health plans publicly post the true prices they pay for prescription drugs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The American people deserve better. \u00a0Making America healthy again will require empowering individuals with the best information possible to inform their life and healthcare choices. \u00a0By building on the historic efforts of my first term, my Administration will make more meaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system.\u00a0Sec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to put patients first and ensure they have the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions. \u00a0The Federal Government will continue to promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices and will take all necessary steps to improve existing price transparency requirements; increase enforcement of price transparency requirements; and identify opportunities to further empower patients with meaningful price information, potentially including through the expansion of existing price transparency requirements.\u00a0Sec. 3. \u00a0Fulfilling the Promise of Radical Transparency. \u00a0The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take all necessary and appropriate action to rapidly implement and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 13877, including, within 90 days of the date of this order, action to:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a) \u00a0require the disclosure of the actual prices of items and services, not estimates;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0issue updated guidance or proposed regulatory action ensuring pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across hospitals and health plans; and\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0issue guidance or proposed regulatory action updating enforcement policies designed to ensure compliance with the transparent reporting of complete, accurate, and meaningful data.Sec. 4. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i) \u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n",
  "summary": "The executive order issued on February 25, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to enhance price transparency within the healthcare sector. Building on Executive Order 13877 from June 2019, this new directive mandates hospitals and health plans to provide detailed and accessible pricing information. These measures are designed to alleviate patients and employers from the undue burden of obscured healthcare costs, offering clear insights into the actual prices of medical services and prescription drugs.\n\nThe President highlights the stalled progress on these transparency efforts since his first term and critiques the subsequent administration for insufficient enforcement. The directive tasks the Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to enforce and update the transparency regulations swiftly. Actions include ensuring real price disclosures, standardizing pricing formats across hospitals, and revising enforcement policies to guarantee compliance.",
  "eli5": "The President wants hospitals to show how much things cost so people can see prices and choose what care they want. Like in stores, when you see the price tags, he wants healthcare to have those too.",
