  "summary": "On March 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced a series of initiatives aimed at reforming various government policies. These actions include designating English as the official language of the United States and ending certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives seen as lowering standards. The Trump Administration also dismissed lawsuits from the Biden era against police and fire departments deemed discriminatory.\n\nAdditionally, the administration took steps to stop the Federal Government from restricting American freedoms, including ordering an end to censorship and banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates at federally funded schools. Trump also emphasized a return to merit-based hiring practices in federal agencies and initiated an examination of regulations related to Second Amendment rights. New national recognitions, such as \"Gulf of America Day,\" were also declared, and specific historical documents were ordered to be declassified.",
