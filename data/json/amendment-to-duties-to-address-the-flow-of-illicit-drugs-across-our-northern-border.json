  "summary": "On March 2, 2025, the President of the United States issued an amendment to Executive Order 14193, initially imposed on February 1, 2025, which addresses the movement of illicit drugs across the northern border of the United States. This amendment involves revising section 2(h), allowing duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 for certain eligible articles. The duty-free treatment is conditional and will cease once the Secretary of Commerce informs the President that adequate systems for processing and collecting tariff revenue are in place.\n\nThe order specifies that its implementation should not interfere with the authority of any executive department or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Moreover, the order must align with existing laws and is dependent on the availability of appropriations. Importantly, the order does not provide any enforceable rights or benefits to any party against the United States or any of its agencies or employees.",
  "eli5": "The President made a rule allowing some goods to pass without paying extra charges if they come from our northern neighbor, but only until we have a better way to manage those charges. This doesn't change other rules or give anyone special rights.",
