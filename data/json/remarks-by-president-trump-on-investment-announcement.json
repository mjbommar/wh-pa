EST\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 This is a very big day for a lot of reasons, but this gentleman is a very unique man.\u00a0 I think I can say, in the world of chips, certainly, but in the world pretty much of business, nobody has done what he\u2019s done.\u00a0 For those of you that are into that world, you would say, \u201cWow, he\u2019s a legend.\u201d\u00a0 But he is a legend.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be with you.\u00a0 Very great honor.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. WEI:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Welcoming, from TSMC \u2014 which is the biggest there is, at a level that you can\u2019t even calculate, frankly \u2014 C.C. Wei, to the White House for a very historic announcement.\u00a0 This is a tremendous thing for our country and, hopefully, for his company.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re also pleased to be joined by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, another two very highly respected people.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you guys involved.\u00a0 And, David, thank you very much for coming on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 David is sort of the king of intellect in that world.\u00a0 We have some good people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion dollars in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities.\u00a0 I think, mostly, it\u2019s going to be in Arizona, which is what I understand, which is a great state.\u00a0 I like it because I won it.\u00a0 But I won most of them \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 actually.\u00a0 So \u2014 but I did.\u00a0 We won it, and we won it big.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America, and it\u2019ll be a big percentage of the chips made by his company.\u00a0 But, as you know, they\u2019re based mostly in Taiwan.\u00a0 And they\u2019re far and away the biggest.\u00a0 There\u2019s nobody even close.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This $100 billion in new investment will go into building five cutting-edge fabrication facilities in the great state that we just discussed, Arizona, and will create thousands of jobs \u2014 many thousands of jobs, and they\u2019re high-paying jobs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In total, today\u2019s announcement brings Taiwan Semiconductor investments to about $165 billion \u2014 they\u2019ve started already \u2014 among the largest new foreign direct investments in United States.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple, as you know, made a big announcement last week of $500 billion, and we have some others that have announced.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have many that want to announce.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t have time to do all of these announcements, I tell you.\u00a0 But, for you, I\u2019m doing the announcement.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. WEI:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America\u2019s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy \u2014 and, really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy \u2014 powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\u00a0 And we must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, in American factories, with American skill and American labor.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\u00a0 And I think \u201cpretty much\u201d is not a term that\u2019s even appropriate.\u00a0 They do have a monopoly.\u00a0 And this is a tremendous move by the most powerful company in the world.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a matter of economic security.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a matter of national security for us.\u00a0 And, at the same time, Mr. Wei will be able to diversify and have his tremendous presence in another place and a very safe place.\u00a0 And I want to thank Taiwan Semiconductor for doing the announcement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to ask Mr. Wei to say a few words, if you might.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I\u2019d also like to ask Howard and David \u2014 you can say a couple of words.\u00a0 But maybe you should go first because, right now, he\u2019s the most important man in the room.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, fellas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Great honor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. WEI:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. WEI:\u00a0 I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a little bit nervous, so I have to pull out my piece of paper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, Secretary Lutnick \u2014 and, David, I didn\u2019t know that \u2014 your title, but \u2014 okay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First, I want to thank \u2014 say thank you to Mr. President to give me this opportunity to announce our big project in the U.S.\u00a0TSMC is the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturing, founded by Dr. Morris Chang in 1987.\u00a0 It\u2019s now at the forefront of semiconductor technology, supporting AI advancement and industry growth.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, I would like to wind back the time that in 2020 we have to thank President Trump\u2019s vision and his support.\u00a0 So, TSMC start the journey of establishing the advanced chip manufacturing in Arizona.\u00a0 And now, let me proudly say, now the vision become reality.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Phoenix, Arizona, with 3,000 employees, we are producing the most advanced chip made on U.S. soil with the success of our first fab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, we are now very happy to announce we are going to invest additional 100 billion U.S. dollar in addition to our current 65-billion-U.S.-dollars investment in Arizona.\u00a0 We are going to build three more new fab \u2014 be- \u2014 after we promised the three fabs already, and another two very advanced packaging fab, and, most important, an R&amp;D center, also in Arizona.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For this, all the investment \u2014 $165 billion \u2014 is going to create thousand of the high-paid job, as the president just announced.\u00a0 And we are, most important \u2014 actually, we are going to produce many AI chips.\u00a0 We are going to produce many chips to support AI\u2019s progress and to support the smartphone\u2019s progress.\u00a0And, again, with that, I want to thank President Trump again for his support.\u00a0 In addition, I also want to thank my customers in the U.S., such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom.\u00a0 They all support TSMC\u2019s manufacturing in the U.S.\u00a0 Without their support, we probably cannot make it true.\u00a0So, again, I want to thank them.\u00a0 Also, I\u2019d like to thank the TSMC\u2019s employee.\u00a0 Without their effort, we just cannot make it today.\u00a0That\u2019s all I want to say.\u00a0 And thank you.\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0Howard, please.\u00a0 David.SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 Sure.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 So, I\u2019m thrilled to be here today, because President Trump has made it a fundamental objective to bring semiconductor chip manufacturing home to America.\u00a0Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion.\u00a0 So, America gave TSMC 10 percent of the money to build here.\u00a0 And now you\u2019re seeing the power of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, because TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with $100 billion investment.\u00a0 And, of course, that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\u00a0So, the idea is: Come to America.\u00a0 Build greatness in America.\u00a0 Build for the American customers \u2014 the Apple, Nvidia, that whole list that Chairman Wei gave \u2014 in order to bring production to America.\u00a0So, we\u2019re really, really excited.\u00a0 This continues the most incredible path you\u2019ve ever seen, in these first weeks and months of the Trump administration, of incredible manufacturing coming to America.\u00a0 The keys that the president has called out are coming here.\u00a0 They\u2019re coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they\u2019re not here, they\u2019d have to suffer.\u00a0So, I want to congratulate C.C. Wei for bringing in this incredible $100 billion investment, but it\u2019s on the shoulders of our president, Donald Trump, which is why he\u2019s coming.\u00a0So, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.David. \u00a0MR. SACKS:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Well, the products that TSMC makes are literally the most important products in the world.\u00a0 I mean, these advanced chips power everything.\u00a0 They power AI.\u00a0 They power your phone.\u00a0 They power your cars.\u00a0 And without them, the whole modern economy would stop, but they\u2019re not made in the United States.\u00a0So, for TSMC to move here is a huge, huge development, and we owe that to President Trump\u2019s leadership on the economy and Secretary Lutnick as well.\u00a0 And, C.C., thank you for \u2014 for coming here.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Yeah.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, David.\u00a0So, thank you very much.\u00a0 A big percentage of chips with this investment will be made now \u2014 a big percentage.\u00a0 Worldwide, we had very little.\u00a0 Almost none.\u00a0 We used to have a lot with Intel.\u00a0 But we had very little.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be at close to 40 percent of the market with this transaction and a couple of others that we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 That\u2019s a tremendous leap \u2014 like, a leap that nobody would have really said was possible.\u00a0So, I just want to thank you all for being here.\u00a0 If you want a couple of questions.(Cross-talk.)Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the \u2014\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ideally on this subject.\u00a0Yes, please.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 specific number of jobs it will create.\u00a0\u00a0 He said thousands \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They \u2014 yeah.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 but do you have a better \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They \u2014 you\u2019re probably talking about 25,000 jobs.\u00a0 But it\u2019ll get bigger and bigger with time.\u00a0 Knowing this gentleman, it\u2019ll get bigger and bigger.\u00a0 There\u2019ll be no stopping him.\u00a0 (Laughs.)Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what more \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Brian, go ahead.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 In addition to the jobs, you talked about national security, and that\u2019s one thing I think a lot of Americans \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 at home don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 Explain the national security aspect of this.\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, without the chips and semiconductors, nothing runs today.\u00a0 You can\u2019t buy a car without them.\u00a0 You can\u2019t get a radio, a television, nothing \u2014 you can\u2019t get anything.\u00a0 And we thought it was very important \u2014 obviously, business was, but we thought even to terms of national security, to have this large percentage of the chips, semiconductors, and other things that they make \u2014 the most important product, and not a product that you can really copy.\u00a0 It takes years and years.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019re on the needle of a pin is total genius.\u00a0 I mean, they can put things \u2014 I mean, something the size of the needle, the point of a pin, they put information that is just not even believable.\u00a0So, if you would \u2014\u00a0(Cross-talk.)\u00a0If you would see this, it\u2019s just really something.\u00a0Yes, Brian.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I \u2014 one \u2014 one more aspect to that.\u00a0 Honda \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 announced they\u2019re coming to Indiana because of the tariffs.\u00a0 Once again \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 you\u2019re bringing additional jobs in manufacturing.\u00a0 Do you want to comment on that as well?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, Honda is coming, and I told you about Apple, that they\u2019re going to be starting to build massively here \u2014 $500 billion.\u00a0 And we have many other companies.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be announced, but we had many that have already announced.\u00a0 And no, it\u2019s going to be great.\u00a0 It\u2019s looking \u2014 it\u2019s looking really strong.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen anything like we\u2019re seeing right now.\u00a0Now, the tariffs, as you know, it will start a week earlier than the reciprocal, which is going to be on \u2014 a couple of weeks earlier.\u00a0 Reciprocal tariffs start on April 2nd.\u00a0 And I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn\u2019t want to do \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to go April Fool\u2019s Day \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 because that cost me \u2014 that costs a lot of money, but \u2014 that one day.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going April 2nd.But very importantly, tomorrow, tariffs \u2014 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico, and that\u2019ll start.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re going to have to have a tariff.\u00a0 So, what they\u2019ll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States \u2014 in which case, they have no tariffs.\u00a0 In other words, you build \u2014 and this is exactly what Mr. Wei is doing by building here.\u00a0 Otherwise, they\u2019ll build \u2014 if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they\u2019ll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday.\u00a0 It\u2019ll go only up.\u00a0 But by doing it here, he has no tariffs, so he\u2019s way ahead of the game.\u00a0And I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they\u2019re going to build car plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here, because we have the market.\u00a0 We\u2019re the market where they sell the most.\u00a0\u00a0And so, I think it\u2019s going to be very exciting.\u00a0 Very exciting for the automobile companies.\u00a0 Very exciting for \u2014 I can think of any \u2014 as an example, North Carolina, they had the great \u2014 I used to go there to buy furniture for hotels, and it\u2019s been wiped out.\u00a0 That business all went to other countries, and now it\u2019s all going to come back into North Carolina \u2014 the furniture manufacturing business.Please.\u00a0\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is the Ukraine minerals deal now dead, or can it be revived?\u00a0 What \u2014 what\u2019s your \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019ll let you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re making a speech \u2014 you probably heard about it \u2014 tomorrow night, so I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow night.\u00a0But, no, I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s \u2014 look, it\u2019s a great deal for us, because, you know, Biden very, very, foolishly \u2014 stupidly, frankly \u2014 gave $300 billion and \u2014 $350 billion, more accurately \u2014 to a country to fight and to try and do things.\u00a0 And you know what happened?\u00a0 We get nothing.\u00a0 We get nothing \u2014 just gave it.\u00a0We could have rebuilt our entire U.S. Navy with $350 billion.\u00a0 Think of it.\u00a0 Three hundred and fifty billion, we could have rebuilt our U.S. Navy.So, he gave it away as fast as the money could be gone.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re doing is getting that all back and a lot more than that.\u00a0 And what we need \u2014 it\u2019s very important for this business that we\u2019re talking about here, with chips and semiconductors and everything else \u2014 we need rare earths.\u00a0 And the deal we have is we have the finest rare earths that you can.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Sir, on Ukraine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to press back \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 What do you need to see from President Zelenskyy to restart these negotiations?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.\u00a0 We\u2019ve given them much more than Europe, and Europe should have given more than us, because, as you know, that\u2019s right there.\u00a0 That\u2019s the border.\u00a0This country really was like the fence on the border.\u00a0 It was very important to Europe.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not knocking Europe, I\u2019m saying they\u2019re just \u2014 they were a lot smarter than Joe Biden, because Joe Biden didn\u2019t have a clue.\u00a0 He just gave money hand over a fist, and they should have been able to equalize with us.\u00a0In other words, if we gave a dollar, they should have given.\u00a0 Well, we gave $350 billion.\u00a0 They probably gave 100, but on top of it all, they get their money back, because they are doing it in the form of a loan, and it\u2019s a secured loan.\u00a0\u00a0So, when I saw that, which I\u2019ve known about for a little while, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to be smart.\u201d\u00a0 At the same time, it\u2019s great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth, which is going to fuel this big engine, and especially the engine that we\u2019ve, in a very short time, created.\u00a0 And we get something, and we\u2019re in the \u2014 we\u2019re there.\u00a0 We have a presence there.\u00a0With all of that being said, I want one thing to happen: I want all of those young people to stop being killed.\u00a0 They\u2019re being killed by the thousands every single week.\u00a0 Last week, 2,700 were killed.\u00a0 Twenty-seven hundred young \u2014 in this case, just about, all young boys from Ukraine and from Russia.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not young people from the United States, but it\u2019s on a human basis.\u00a0I want to see it stop.\u00a0 The money is one thing, but the death.\u00a0 And they\u2019re losing thousands of soldiers a week, and that\u2019s not including the people that get killed every time a town goes down or a missile goes into a town.(Cross-talk.)We \u2014 and \u2014 and I want to see it stop.\u00a0Yes.\u00a0\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, are you considering canceling military aid to Ukraine?\u00a0 And can we get a reaction to what the Kremlin just said, that your administration is bringing U.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow\u2019s?\u00a0\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, this is a deal that should have never happened.\u00a0 This is a deal that would have never happened, and it didn\u2019t happen \u2014 for four years, it didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 It was never even close to happening.\u00a0 If I were president, would not have happened.\u00a0 And October 7th would have \u2014 would not have happened in Israel.\u00a0 And inflation wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0And Afghanistan, disastrous \u2014 the way they withdrew \u2014 not the fact that they withdrew but the way they withdrew \u2014 would have never happened.\u00a0 And we would have had Bagram right now instead of China having it.\u00a0 It was one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We would have kept Bagram \u2014 one of the biggest air bases in the world.\u00a0All of these things happened, and it\u2019s a shame.\u00a0 But it is what it is, and now we\u2019re here.\u00a0 I want to see it end fast.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see this go on for years and years.Now, President Zelenskyy supposedly made a statement today in AP \u2014 I\u2019m not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement \u2014 but he said he thinks the war is going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that.\u00a0 That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, is there any \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could this project \u2014 could this minimize the impact of the U.S. with chips should China decide to isolate Taiwan or China decide to take Taiwan?\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s a very interesting point.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great question, actually.\u00a0 But this would certainly \u2014 I can\u2019t say \u201cminimize.\u201d\u00a0 That would be a catastrophic event, obviously.\u00a0 But it will at least give us a position where we have \u2014 in this very, very important business, we would have a very big part of it in the United States.\u00a0 So, it would have a big impact if something should happen with Taiwan.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And with Russia sanctions, are you looking at relieving Russian sanctions if there is a peace deal?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to make deals with everybody to get this war, including Europe and European nations.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve acted very well.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019re good people.\u00a0 I know; most of them are friends of mine \u2014 the heads of state, the heads of the various countries, prime ministers from the different \u2014 I got four prime ministers and five presidents called me over the last two days, and they want to work it out.\u00a0 They want to get it worked out.\u00a0\u00a0And I think they\u2019re also \u2014 you know, they\u2019re talking money, but the money is less important than the deaths.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking thousands of young people a week.\u00a0 And people would say why do I care about Ukraine, young people; why do I care about \u2014 and not all young, but they\u2019re pretty young.\u00a0 You know, Ukraine is running a little bit low, and they\u2019re getting older.\u00a0 They\u2019re recruiting older people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very, very sad thing that\u2019s happening over there, and we want to get it finished.\u00a0 We want to stop the death.\u00a0(Cross-talk.)Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on the tariffs.\u00a0 Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight?\u00a0 And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent to take effect tomorrow?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No room left for Mexico or for Canada.\u00a0 No, the tariffs, you know, they\u2019re all set.\u00a0 They go into effect tomorrow.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, just a follow-up on my colleague\u2019s question.\u00a0 Hearing \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico and, as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada.\u00a0 And China also had an additional 10, so it\u2019s 10 plus 10.\u00a0\u00a0And it comes in from Canada, and it comes in from Mexico, and that\u2019s a very important thing to say.Yeah, please.\u00a0 Go ahead.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you decided if you\u2019re going to suspend military aid to Ukraine?\u00a0 Have you made that decision?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I haven\u2019t even talked about that right now.\u00a0 I mean, right now, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 A lot of things are happening right now, as we speak \u2014 I mean, literally as we speak.\u00a0 I could give you an answer and go back to my office \u2014 the beautiful Oval Office.\u00a0 I could go back into the Oval Office and find out that the answer is obsolete.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s like his business.\u00a0 It\u2019s obsolete.\u00a0 You come up with a new chip, and it\u2019s obsolete about two minutes later, right?\u00a0 But that\u2019s what\u2019s good about his business.\u00a0 That\u2019s why he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s successful in it.\u00a0 But \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And on tariffs, sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, just to follow up my colleague\u2019s question from Russia is saying that your foreign policy is largely in line with their vision.\u00a0 Should that be concerning to Americans?\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Said what?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should that be concerning to Americans?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Read the statement.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That Russia \u2014 Russia says that your administration\u2019s foreign policy is, quote, \u201clargely in line\u201d with their vision.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you\u2019re going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you\u2019re going to have to make a deal with Ukraine.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have to have the ascent, and you\u2019re going to have to have the consent from the European nations, because I think that\u2019s important, and from us.\u00a0I think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal.\u00a0 And the deal could be made very fast.\u00a0 It should not be that hard a deal to make.\u00a0 It could be made very fast.\u00a0Now, maybe somebody doesn\u2019t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn\u2019t want to make a deal, I think that person won\u2019t be around very long.\u00a0 That person will not be listened to very long.\u00a0 Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal.\u00a0 I believe, certainly, the people of Ukraine want to make a deal.\u00a0 They\u2019ve suffered more than anybody else.\u00a0 We talk about suffering \u2014 they\u2019ve suffered.But if you think about it, under President Bush, they got Georgia, right?\u00a0 Russia got Georgia.\u00a0 Under President Obama, they got a nice, big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines.\u00a0 You know that, right?\u00a0 Crimea.\u00a0 Under President Trump, they got nothing.\u00a0 And under President O-Biden, they tried to get the whole thing.\u00a0 They tried to get the whole big Ukraine, the whole thing.\u00a0 If I didn\u2019t get in here, they would\u2019ve gotten the whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0So, I can only say \u2014 you can go back to Bush, you go back to Obama, and go back to Biden \u2014 they took a lot.\u00a0 The only one they didn\u2019t get \u2014 you know what I gave them?\u00a0 I gave them anti-tank missiles.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I gave them.\u00a0 I gave them sanctions on Russia \u2014 on Russia.\u00a0 I gave them Javelins.\u00a0 You know the Javelins?\u00a0 You know when they took out all those tanks?You know, the tanks were heading to Kyiv by the hundreds, and they were unstoppable, and I gave them Javelins.\u00a0So, you know, I really \u2014 Putin is the one that will tell you this has not been so good for them.\u00a0 The fact is that I just want fairness.\u00a0 I want fairness.\u00a0But think of it.\u00a0 I gave Russia nothing except grief.\u00a0 I gave them nothing.\u00a0 I gave them sanctions and Javelins.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I gave them.\u00a0Obama gave them sheets.\u00a0 And you heard that statement before.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very famous \u2014 Trump gave them Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets.\u00a0 And then they say how close I am to Russia.\u00a0Let me tell you, we have to make a deal, because there are a lot of people being killed that shouldn\u2019t be killed.\u00a0 But remember, Trump gave them nothing, and the other presidents gave them a lot.\u00a0 They gave them everything.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on trade.\u00a0 You met with president \u2014 Argentine President Javier Milei at CPAC.\u00a0 He wants to sign a free trade agreement \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 with the United States.\u00a0 Is that something that you would consider, even with Argentina, or any other country?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll consider anything.\u00a0 And Argentina \u2014 I think he\u2019s great, by the way.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s a great leader.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing a great job.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 Brought it back from oblivion.\u00a0Yeah, we\u2019ll look at things.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at the UK with things.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t have to be tariffs.\u00a0 But tariffs are easy, they\u2019re fast, they\u2019re efficient, and they bring fairness.\u00a0For instance, when people kill their dollar, their equivalent of the dollar, whatever \u2014 whether it\u2019s the yuan or the yen in Japan or the yuan in China \u2014 when they drop them down, that gives us \u2014 that puts us at a very unfair disadvantage.\u00a0 So, all I have to do is say, \u201cHoward, we\u2019re going to have to raise the tariffs a little bit.\u201dBecause I\u2019ve called President Xi, I\u2019ve called the leaders of Japan to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t continue to reduce and break down your currency.\u00a0 You can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s unfair to us.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard for us to make tractors \u2014 Caterpillar \u2014 here, when Japan, China, and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down.\u00a0So, all of these things add up, and the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs.\u00a0 Because when they do that, instead of having to make phone calls every day, like I used to do with certain leaders \u2014 President Xi, a little bit \u2014 a lot of phone calls talking about the fact that they\u2019re lowering their yuan.\u00a0 They\u2019re lowering it down.\u00a0 And that makes it very, very hard for us.\u00a0So, this way, I just say, \u201cLook, let them do that, and we make up for it with the tariffs.\u201d\u00a0 But \u2014Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you be speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum about tariffs today?\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, sure, I will.\u00a0 I have a lot of respect for her.\u00a0 I have a lot of respect for her.\u00a0(Cross-talk.)\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the 10 percent tariff take ef- \u2014THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 takes effect, it\u2019ll be 20 percent on China now.\u00a0 How high are you willing to go against China?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I can\u2019t say.\u00a0 It depends on what they do with their currency.\u00a0 It depends on what they do in terms of a retaliation with some kind of an economic retaliation, which I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to retaliate too much.\u00a0\u00a0Hey, look, the United States has been taken advantage of for 40 years.\u00a0 The United States has been a laughing stock for years and years.\u00a0 That\u2019s why this gentleman has built in Taiwan, instead of building here.\u00a0 It would have been better if he built here.\u00a0\u00a0If we had a president that knew what they were doing \u2014 and we had a lot of them very bad on trade.\u00a0 Look, I\u2019m a huge fan of Ronald Reagan, but he was bad on trade.\u00a0 Very bad on trade.\u00a0 He allowed a lot of people, a lot of businesses, to be taken.\u00a0 So, I say that with due respect, because I \u2014 he was so great on other things, but he was bad on trade.\u00a0We are setting records right now \u2014 records like nobody has ever seen before.\u00a0 When you have companies like this coming in and almost 40 percent of their company, in one signature, is going to be devoted to what he does, which is one of the most important \u2014 important businesses in the world, that\u2019s an unbelievable thing.\u00a0 When Apple now is going to start building all of their plants here, all because of what we\u2019ve done in terms of \u2014 it\u2019s not because he likes me or they like me.\u00a0 They don\u2019t probably like me at all.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I think he likes me a little bit, at least.\u00a0 (Laughter.)MR. WEI:\u00a0 No, I like you.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 It\u2019s the incentive we\u2019ve created or the negative incentive.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country.\u00a0 They can\u2019t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they\u2019re being punished by tariffs.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a very powerful weapon that politicians haven\u2019t used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re using them.Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken with President Xi?Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Agriculture \u2014\u00a0THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken with President Xi about this this term?THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to tell you that.\u00a0Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On those incentives, sir.THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0(Cross-talk.)\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 END\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3:07 P.M.

  "summary": "On March 3, 2025, President Trump announced a significant investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in the United States during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. TSMC, led by C.C. Wei, plans to invest a minimum of $100 billion to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Arizona, creating thousands of high-paying jobs. This investment aims to boost the production of advanced AI chips in the U.S., enhancing national security and economic dominance in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe announcement included remarks from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who both lauded the investment as a testament to President Trump's economic policies. The TSMC investment will significantly increase the percentage of semiconductor manufacturing within the U.S., addressing concerns over national security due to Taiwan's monopoly on chip manufacturing. The press conference also discussed broader economic impacts, including tariffs and trade relations with countries like Canada, Mexico, and China.\n\nIn addition to the TSMC announcement, President Trump highlighted other significant investments, such as Apple's $500 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing. He emphasized the importance of having a domestic supply of semiconductors for both economic and national security, and reiterated his administration's focus on bolstering domestic manufacturing through various incentives and tariffs.",
