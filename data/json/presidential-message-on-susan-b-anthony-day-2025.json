Anthony Day, 2025\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 15, 2025\n\nToday, we celebrate the birthday of Susan B. Anthony, a warrior for women and hero of Equality, Justice, and the Constitutional rule of law.\n\nFor her entire life, Susan B. Anthony was fiercely devoted to the principle that every American, regardless of race or sex, is born with the God-given right to enjoy the blessings of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Years later, her fearless crusade for Equality culminated in the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which blocked states from denying citizens the right to vote on the basis of sex. Throughout her storied life, she also emerged as a champion of the abolitionist movement and a tireless advocate for the sanctity of life.\n\nAs President, I have already taken historic action to advance the sacred causes that Susan B. Anthony cherished so deeply. I was honored to sign an Executive Order safeguarding women\u2019s sports\u2014ensuring the survival of free and competitive spaces for female athletes. Additionally, I was proud to order the end of taxpayer-funded abortion\u2014a big win for the most vulnerable among us.\n\nWhile my Administration continues to honor the legacy of Susan B. Anthony and promote our shared cause of Liberty and Justice for all, I also want to thank our Nation\u2019s First Lady, Melania Trump, for previously hosting a White House celebration with America\u2019s youth to honor the centennial anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. I know she looks forward to continuing to help empower and support girls and women in the United States and around the globe.\n\nToday, Melania joins me in paying tribute to Susan B. Anthony\u2019s perseverance, leadership, and monumental achievements. Let us continue her life\u2019s work of creating a culture that celebrates the enduring triumph of Freedom, the dignity of life, and the full glory of the American promise.\n",
