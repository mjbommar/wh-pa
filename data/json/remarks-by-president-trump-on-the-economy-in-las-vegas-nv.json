EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ah, hello, Las Vegas.\u00a0 Hello, Las Vegas.\n\nHello, Nevada.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Trump!\u00a0 Trump!\u00a0 Trump!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we won.\u00a0 We won.\u00a0 We won.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd it\u2019s great to be back in this beautiful city to celebrate the historic first week in the White House.\u00a0 That was definitely a start.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I had a lot of help in winning.\u00a0\n\nJoe Lombardo, your governor, is here someplace.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Joe?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Joe.\u00a0 You\u2019re looking good, Joe.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 What a group.\u00a0 Look at who you have next you.\u00a0 How can you fail with that guy?\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAlso, Lieutenant Governor Stavros.\u00a0 Anthony Stavros, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 There you are, Stavros.\u00a0 You\u2019re very good.\u00a0\n\nIs he doing a good job, Joe?\u00a0 I think so, huh?\u00a0 He\u2019s all right, huh?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nNevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald, he \u2014 (applause) \u2014 he did something which not a lot of people have been able to do, but I think Republicans are going to start winning this state.\u00a0 You know, typically, they don\u2019t necessarily do so good.\u00a0 We did really well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We won in a landslide.\u00a0 That\u2019s really why I\u2019m here, I must be honest with you.\u00a0\n\nRepublican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Sigal, thank you, wherever you may be.\u00a0 Hi, Sigal.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\nRepublican National Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a hell of a beautiful name.\u00a0 But I know the name so long, it\u2019s easy to say.\u00a0\n\nOne of the greatest people, I\u2019ll tell you \u2014 a man who\u2019s done so damn well.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what it is with him.\u00a0 He\u2019s just a legend.\u00a0 He\u2019s one person \u2014 you know, we can all sort of be replaced, although we don\u2019t like to think that \u2014 maybe it\u2019s not true \u2014 but this is a guy that can\u2019t be replaced.\u00a0 There\u2019s nobody like him: Dana White.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Where\u2019s Dana White?\u00a0 Where is Dana White?\u00a0 Where the hell is he?\u00a0 UFC.\u00a0\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 Nelk Boys!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s great. Are the Nelk Boys here?\u00a0 Oh, yeah.\u00a0 There they are, the Nelk Boys.\u00a0 Right there.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nAnd Rick Harrison.\u00a0 Rick, thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You\u2019re around here someplace with Dana.\n\nMr. Phil Ruffin; his wife, Oleksandra; and their two beautiful children, Richard and Malena.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Phil?\u00a0 Where\u2019s Ruffin?\u00a0 Where is Phil Ruffin?\u00a0 He\u2019s right here.\u00a0 Say, he\u2019s some legend, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 He\u2019s a legend in Las Vegas and beyond.\u00a0 Phil.\u00a0 He\u2019s here.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be coming out.\u00a0\n\nToday, we talk about how we\u2019re going to end the economic suffering and stagnation and disaster of the past four years and create the four greatest years in the history of our country.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0\n\nAnd as I said in my Inaugural Address which, by the way, it got the highest rating in the history of Fox.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0 That\u2019s nice \u2014 \u201cthe golden age of America begins right now.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nBut I have to be honest with you, I\u2019m really here for a different reason.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to say thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nI went to North Carolina yesterday, and then I flew to see just an unbelievable problem in \u2014 just a mess in Los Angeles, right?\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYou know what I ought to do?\u00a0 I want to come to a state known as \u2018Nevada.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Has anyone ever heard of it?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And don\u2019t ever mispronounce the name.\u00a0 You\u2019re not allowed to do that, Chair.\u00a0 You mispronounce the name; you\u2019re going have a problem.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nYou ever see somebody when they say it\u2019s \u201cNev-ah-da\u201d?\u00a0\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u201cNev-ah-da\u201d?\u00a0 No, they\u2019re in deep \u2014 they\u2019re in deep trouble.\u00a0\n\nI want to come to Nevada to pay my respects, because this is the only Republican win of this state in decades, and it was a very big landslide, so \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 But I think Republicans are going to win a lot now.\n\nBut it was a big \u2014 we had a big win, and it was an early win.\u00a0 And that was a bad signal for the Democrats; they heard that we were leading so big here.\u00a0\n\nAnd Joe helped us so much, and a lot of people in this room helped us a lot.\u00a0 Special group.\u00a0 Special group.\n\nAnd so, I said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ll do?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to fly around it.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLet\u2019s fly right over it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s land, and I\u2019ll do something.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll just say it.\u201d But I want to say it, and I\u2019m almost saying it right here for the media.\u00a0 I just came here because I wanted to thank the people of Nevada for giving us such a big win.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 A lot of great friends.\u00a0 I better not introduce them all, I\u2019ll be here all day.\u00a0\n\nUnder our leadership, we\u2019re going to defeat inflation, bring down prices, we\u2019re going to raise those wages.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to go up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They\u2019re going to go up.\u00a0 Put more money in your pocket, secure our borders, restore law and order to our cities, and we\u2019re going to make America great again.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nAnd for four long years, the last administration waged war on the American middle class and everybody else.\u00a0 They had a lot of wars.\u00a0 We had no wars when I left.\u00a0 You know, we defeated ISIS, and we stayed out.\u00a0 Nobody wanted to mess with us.\u00a0 They had a lot of wars.\u00a0 We\u2019re still \u2014 we\u2019re trying to put them out.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get them put out.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get them put out.\u00a0\n\nWe were \u2014 we were headed to World War III.\u00a0 I\u2019m telling you; we would have had problems like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\n\nThey shut down American energy; buried you in crippling regulation; imposed hidden taxes; and spent trillions and trillions of dollars on waste, corruption, and radical left lunacy.\u00a0 These were lunatics.\u00a0\n\nThe result was the most brutal inflation in a half a century \u2014 perhaps ever in this country \u2014 I think ever \u2014 and soaring prices for food, groceries, and other household goods.\u00a0\n\nThe people of Nevada are now paying nearly $1,200 per month more to make ends meet since I left office.\u00a0 Think of that: $1,200, at least.\u00a0\n\nBut since I became the 47th president at noon on Monday, I\u2019ve been moving with urgency and historic speed \u2014 (applause) \u2014 to fix every single calamity of the Biden administration that they\u2019ve created.\u00a0\n\nAnd this week alone, I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What they\u2019ve done to the \u2014 what they\u2019ve done to this country, especially the open borders, where they have \u2014 think of it \u2014 21 million people came in.\u00a0 Many of them are criminals, murderers.\u00a0\n\nWell, we\u2019re getting them out.\u00a0 You see it.\u00a0 You see it yesterday \u2014 first day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nOur message could not be clearer: America\u2019s decline is over.\u00a0 American decline is over.\n\nWe\u2019re laughed at all over the world.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re not laughed at anymore, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0\n\nWhat the world witnessed this week is nothing less than a revolution of wealth creation for everyone and also common sense.\u00a0 It\u2019s about common sense.\u00a0 It really is.\u00a0 We\u2019re the party of common sense.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nOn day one, I directed every member of my Cabinet to \u2014 and, by the way, Pete Hegseth got approved.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nAnd Kristi Noem just got approved.\u00a0 Governor, she\u2019s going it \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 She\u2019s tough.\u00a0 She\u2019s a tough one.\u00a0 She\u2019s a tough one, and she\u2019s going to do a great job.\u00a0\n\nOn day one, I directed every member of my Cabinet to marshal all powers at their disposal to defeat inflation and bring down the cost of daily life.\u00a0 We want to bring prices down.\u00a0 Too high.\u00a0 They went way up.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t come down.\u00a0\n\nI imposed a federal hiring freeze, a federal regulation freeze, a foreign aid freeze.\u00a0 Oh, that\u2019s a nice one.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd I created the new Department of Government Efficiency.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have a lot of good people \u2014 Elon.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get Elon Musk to get involved in that a little bit.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He already is.\u00a0 People like him.\n\nI terminated the ridiculous and incredibly wasteful Green New Scam.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t the environment supposed to eat us up, like, in 12 years?\u00a0 But that was, like, 13 years ago.\u00a0 What happened?\u00a0 We\u2019re still here.\u00a0 We\u2019re still here.\u00a0 Remember, \u201cWe have 12 years to live.\u201d\u00a0 Remember that?\u00a0 Done by somebody that never even took a course on the environment.\n\nAOC plus three.\u00a0 Do you remember those three?\u00a0 They were telling us about the environment.\u00a0 AOC plus three.\u00a0\n\nThis action alone will save hundreds of billions of dollars of American taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nI withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nAnd I canceled the insane and costly electric vehicle mandate \u2014 (applause) \u2014 keeping my sacred pledge to America\u2019s autoworkers.\u00a0 Boy, did we get a big vote with the autoworkers, I\u2019ll tell you \u2014 and the Teamsters.\u00a0 Any Teamster in the room?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We got a tremendous vote from the Teamsters.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Pointing like \u2014 one \u2014 one guy, all there is.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But they voted for us in the millions.\u00a0 We had a lot of Teamsters voting for us.\u00a0\n\nI withdrew from the World Health Organization \u2014 (applause) \u2014 where we paid $500 million a year and China paid $39 million a year, despite a much larger population.\u00a0 Think of that: China is paying $39 million.\u00a0 They have 1.4 billion people.\u00a0 We pay $500 million.\u00a0 We have \u2014 nobody knows what the hell we have.\u00a0 Does anyone know?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We have so many people pouring in, we have no idea.\u00a0\n\nWe go up, but we\u2019re going down a little bit now.\u00a0 You don\u2019t mind that, do you?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Going to take some bad ones out.\u00a0\n\nI would do it four years ago, but Biden immediately went back for even more money.\u00a0 I mean, he went back and \u2014 you know, they offered me at $39 million.\u00a0 They said, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you back in at $39.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to reduce it from $500 to $39.\u201d\u00a0 I turned them down, because it became so popular.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know if it would be well received, even at $39.\n\nBut maybe we would consider doing it again.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Maybe we would.\u00a0 They have to clean it up a little bit.\u00a0\n\nBut China pays $39 million for 1.4 billion, and we\u2019re paying $500 million for 325 million.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with these people. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd then when Biden went back in \u2014 you know, they immediately went back in \u2014 they paid more than we were paying in the first place.\u00a0 They paid more than the $500 million.\u00a0 So, they knew they could have had it for $39.\u00a0 They paid more.\u00a0\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t do that, Joe, right?\u00a0 No, think of it.\u00a0 They know they have a deal at $39, so they went back in at $525 million.\u00a0 What the hell?\u00a0 Man, oh, man.\u00a0 It just infuriates you, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI declared a national energy emergency to unlock the liquid gold under our feet \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and pave the way for rapid approvals of the new energy infrastructure.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThe United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth.\u00a0 We may be a very substantially enlarged country in the not too distant\u2013 isn\u2019t it nice to see?\u00a0\n\nYou know, for years, for decades, we\u2019re the same size to the square foot \u2014 probably got smaller, actually \u2014 but we might be an enlarged country pretty soon.\u00a0\n\nAnd one of the things we\u2019re going to be doing is drill, baby \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Drill!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 drill.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because that\u2019s going to bring everything down.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to bring everything down.\u00a0\n\nMy administration has also begun the largest deregulation campaign in the history of our country, far exceeding I had the record four year \u2014 we ran \u2014 we had a great economy \u2014 the greatest economy that we\u2019ve ever had \u2014 four years ago.\u00a0 But this is going to be better.\u00a0 You watch, this will be better even than the first term.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nAnd the reason I got elected was because of the first term.\u00a0 You know, somebody said, \u201cWhat was the reason you got elected?\u00a0 I mean, you won by so much.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cMy first term.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You know.\u00a0 It\u2019s all I did.\u00a0 I just said, \u201cWell, take a look at the numbers.\u00a0 Take a look at the numbers.\u201d\n\nIn total, the Biden administration imposed $50,000 in additional regulation costs on the average American.\u00a0 And think of this: The average American was paying much more than $50,000.\u00a0 And, you know, just think of it.\u00a0 Nobody can even believe the numbers.\u00a0\n\nI promise to eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation.\u00a0 So, if we put in a regulation \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we have to get rid of 10.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I did.\u00a0 I did it \u2014 I did it one in seven.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do 1 in 10 this time, which will soon put many thousands of dollars back into your pockets, in the pockets of American families.\n\nAs a result of the reforms, we\u2019ve just begun to implement economic confidence, and it\u2019s soaring.\u00a0\n\nSo, this week, Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank announced Stargate, a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure \u2014 which is going to be very big for Nevada, I have to tell you, the largest in history, and which will create an estimated 100,000 American jobs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nSaudi Arabia just said that they\u2019re going to invest at least $600 billion.\u00a0 This is because of the election, by the way.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I believe they\u2019ll make it a trillion. \u00a0I\u2019m going to ask them to make it $1 trillion.\u00a0 What the hell, the money means nothing to them.\n\nYou know, where they made their money?\u00a0 From liquid gold, right?\u00a0 They got a lot of liquid gold.\u00a0 We have more.\u00a0 We have more than Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got a lot.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got more.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got more than anybody.\u00a0 We just don\u2019t use it because of the environment.\u00a0 These people are crazy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nAnd many other companies, likewise, are looking to invest, but I don\u2019t have enough time to do that, and we have a lot of news conferences.\u00a0 Everybody wants to have a news conference.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019re calling up by the hundreds, \u201cWe want to have a news conference.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to invest $12.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cIt\u2019s got to be $1 billion or more for a news conference.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s $1 billion or more.\n\nJust two days ago, because of our tariff plans, Stellantis announced \u2014 that\u2019s a very good automobile company \u2014 the revival of its Belvidere, Illinois, plant, saving 1,500 American auto jobs that were previously headed to Canada \u2014 (applause) \u2014 along with major investments to expand American auto production in Detroit, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Kokomo, Indiana.\u00a0 Good place.\u00a0\n\nAll of these investments are happening only because of our historic victory.\u00a0 And if we didn\u2019t win, it\u2019d be just the opposite.\u00a0 They\u2019re pulling out.\u00a0 They were pulling out.\u00a0 They were really pulling out.\u00a0 So, they would be withdrawing money.\u00a0\n\nOur country was on the verge of some of the very bad things, and bad things were happening.\u00a0 And now there\u2019s light, not only over America \u2014 I\u2019ve heard it from even our enemies.\u00a0 They call up and they say, \u201cSir, we hate you.\u00a0 We do hate you, but there\u2019s light over the world right now.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They hate me.\u00a0 Some of them hate me.\u00a0 If they liked me, you got a problem, right?\u00a0 They liked Sleepy Joe.\u00a0 What\u2019s not to like?\u00a0\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know, they\u2019d call up \u2014 it\u2019s funny.\u00a0 I was told today by one of the big leaders of the world \u2014 would call for a telephone call with the president of the United States a year ago, and they\u2019d say, \u201cWe\u2019d like to speak with\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWho is this?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the head of Germany, the head of \u2014 it\u2019s\u201d \u2014 name it \u2014 \u201cthe head of France.\u201d\u00a0 The name of any country; it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 He would never pick up the call.\u00a0 They\u2019d say, \u201cHe\u2019ll call you back in two months.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cTwo months?\u201d\u00a0\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 He\u2019s sleeping!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u201cYeah, it\u2019s his schedule.\u00a0 He\u2019s extremely busy\u201d \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 sleeping \u2014 no, it \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\n\nMacron of France, \u201cHe\u2019ll call you back in two months.\u201d\u00a0 So, two months comes along, and there\u2019s no call.\u00a0 They\u2019d say \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 \u201cHe didn\u2019t call.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\n\nThe stories are \u2014 I mean, these stories are not very exaggerated.\u00a0 I want to tell you, they\u2019re a little bit for laughter, but, you know, it\u2019s only for laughter.\n\nThe fake news will say, \u201cOh, he exaggerated.\u00a0 It was only one month.\u201d\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nBut they would say, \u201cHe\u2019ll call you back.\u201d\u00a0 And then he\u2019d never call, and then they could never get him on the phone.\u00a0\n\nAnd the problem I have is that when I speak to the \u2014 and I speak to them immediately \u2014 they\u2019ll say, \u201cCould we speak to the president?\u00a0 Would that be possible?\u00a0 We can do it any time over the next month.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re so used to this, right?\u00a0 I say, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll pick it up right now.\u00a0 Is he on the other phone?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHello.\u00a0 How you doing?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s what \u2014 you know, get it \u2014 get it over with, right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Get it over with.\n\nThe only problem: They were so starved for love from the United States, I cannot get them off the phone.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I can\u2019t get people \u2014 if you can\u2019t, I say, \u201cI have to go now, King,\u201d or \u201cI have to go now, President.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But you can\u2019t get them off the phone.\u00a0 They\u2019re starved for love.\u00a0 You know, for years, they haven\u2019t spoken.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They didn\u2019t even know we had a president, if you want to know.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nBut under our leadership, America is back, open for business, and it\u2019s really a big deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s really a big \u2014\n\nAnd they have, though.\u00a0 They said, you know, there\u2019s like a light all over the world now.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just here.\u00a0 We feel the light over our country.\u00a0 Everyone does.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a light all over the world.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve accomplished more in one week that other administrations have accomplished in four years, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nWe got rid of the woke.\u00a0 We got rid of the woke crap.\u00a0 What a lot \u2014 (applause) \u2014 what a lot of stuff.\u00a0 What a lot of crap that was.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It was \u2014 and, you know, these people were petrified of it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you, these companies \u2014 they run these big companies \u2014 they were petrified of it.\u00a0 It was like \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t think they believed it.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 Some, I know, didn\u2019t believe it, but they were so afraid.\u00a0\n\nNear the top of the agenda for our historic Republican majorities in Congress is to pass a massive tax cut for American workers and families.\u00a0\n\nLast year, we campaigned across the country on a pledge that I\u2019m sure most of you didn\u2019t hear too much about \u2014 a pledge to take the Trump tax cuts and make them permanent, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll be working with Congress to get a bill on my desk that cuts taxes for workers, families, small businesses, and, very importantly, keeps my promise for a thing called \u2014 and I know you didn\u2019t hear anything about this, and I\u2019m sure it had no influence on the state; the fact that we won this crazy, massive majority \u2014 the state that hadn\u2019t been won by a Republican in decades.\u00a0 But I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t heard, but we\u2019re going to get it for you: No tax on tips.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 No tax on tips.\u00a0 Right?\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, or one of my caddies \u2014 I go through caddies like candy \u2014 (laughter); if I play badly, I always blame my caddy \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 or any other worker who relies on tipped income, your tips will be 100 percent yours.\u00a0 Won\u2019t that be nice?\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nJoe \u2014 Governor, do you think that had an impact on the election?\u00a0\n\nGOVERNOR LOMBARDO:\u00a0 Absolutely!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You do?\u00a0 Like, what, a half a point?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty big.\u00a0 You had an impact, let me tell you.\u00a0\n\nNationwide, over 4 million workers depend on tip income, including an estimated 700,000 single moms.\u00a0 And here in Nevada, we will have a quarter \u2014 think of it, a quarter of the typical restaurant worker\u2019s pay comes from tips.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know that much.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 You haven\u2019t been reporting them for the last 10 years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nSo, here\u2019s our deal, we\u2019re going to have no tax on tips from now on, but we\u2019re going to go after you viciously for all the money you didn\u2019t report for the last ten, fif- \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 we\u2019re going to go after you for all the money you didn\u2019t report for \u2014 I\u2019m only kidding.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019m only kidding.\u00a0 I have to say to the fake news, because they\u2019re going to say, \u201cTrump is after all restaurant workers.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMany of these workers are some of the very citizens who were hit hard and very hard by the ravages of the Biden economy, which was inflation.\u00a0 When I think of Biden, I think of incompetence \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and inflation.\u00a0 I\u2019m being nice by saying \u2014 I\u2019m being nice when I say that.\u00a0 Yet, even in the midst of the suffering he created, Joe Biden launched a cruel campaign to extract more money from tip workers, and that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m telling you, a young waitress \u2014 I won\u2019t say \u201cbeautiful,\u201d because you\u2019re not allowed to say that \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 as a politician.\u00a0 It used to be, you could say, \u201cA young, beautiful waitress,\u201d because \u2014 and this was a young, beautiful waitress, but I won\u2019t say that because I feel like \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I want to continue my political career.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 If you call some the governor won\u2019t say it.\u00a0 If you call a woman \u201cbeautiful\u201d today, it\u2019s the end of your political career, so I won\u2019t do it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nBut a young waitress \u2014 I think you could call \u201cyoung.\u201d\u00a0 You\u2019re probably not even supposed to say \u201cyoung.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re probably supposed to say \u201ca waitress.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But a young waitress came up, and I said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\u00a0 And in my restaurant, in the hotel, in Trump \u2014 I said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\u00a0 And she said, \u201cNot great, because they\u2019re after me so viciously for tips.\u00a0 They just want my tip income, and they don\u2019t believe me,\u201d and all of this.\u00a0\n\nAnd she said, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 You know, sir, you should have no tax on tips.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat you just say?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo tax on tips.\u201d\u00a0 That was about the amount of my consultation.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 No tax.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u00a0 Say those words again.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSir, no tax on tips.\u201d\u00a0 I said, are you \u2014 thank you very much.\u00a0 You just won the election for\u201d \u2014 (applause).\u00a0\n\nNo, but, we did research into it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be great.\u00a0\n\nBut under the Trump administration, the forgotten men and women of our country are going to be forgotten no longer.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t forgotten four years ago.\n\nOn day one, I immediately halted the hiring of any new IRS agents.\u00a0 You know they hired \u2014 (applause) \u2014 they hired or tried to hire 88,000 new workers to go after you, and we\u2019re in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we\u2019ll move them to the border.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to move them to the border.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nWell, they\u2019re allowed to carry guns.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019re so strong on guns, but these people are allowed to carry guns, so we\u2019ll probably move them to the border.\u00a0\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 How about no tax on anything?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 She said \u201cno tax on any-\u201d \u2014 how about just no tax, period?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We could do that.\u00a0\n\nYou know, if the tariffs work out like I think, a thing like that could happen, if you want to know the truth.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nYou know, years ago, 1870 to 1913, we didn\u2019t have an income tax.\u00a0 What we had is tariffs.\u00a0 Where foreign countries came in and they stole our jobs, they stole our companies, they stole our product, they ripped us off, and, you know, they used to do numbers, and then we went to tariff \u2014 a tariff system.\u00a0 And the tariff system made so much money.\u00a0 It was when we were the richest \u2014 from 1870 to 1913 \u2014 then we came in with the \u2014 brilliantly came in with an income tax.\u00a0 \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want others to pay.\u00a0 Let\u2019s have our people pay.\u201d\u00a0 And then you had the depression in 1928, 1929.\u00a0 I call it 1929.\u00a0 That was a bad time.\u00a0\n\nBut, you know, you didn\u2019t have tariffs, and you had tariffs that ended in 1913.\u00a0 But it was the richest our country ever was.\u00a0 That was President McKinley.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019re renaming the mountain \u201cMount McKinley\u201d \u2014 in Alaska.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nYou know what else we\u2019re renaming?\u00a0 We\u2019re renaming the Gulf of \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:\u00a0 Mexico!\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:\u00a0 America!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 Mexico into the Gulf of America.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Mexico \u2014 actually, they were thrilled when they heard.\u00a0 They said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nA few months from now, when I sign our tax cut into law, we\u2019re going to deliver for the tip-earning men and women who make it all work.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s going to be something very special, I think, for you.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a big difference.\u00a0\n\nAnd with us today is Jessica Angiano [ph], an employee here at Circa.\u00a0 This is a nice place, by the way, and I just met your owner.\u00a0 He\u2019s a nice man.\u00a0 He\u2019s rich, too \u2014 very rich.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 But Circa is very nice.\u00a0\n\nAnd a hardworking single mother of two with incredible children, Jessica is struggling to pay for medical bills to remove a tumor behind her right eye.\u00a0 She\u2019s had some real difficulty, and she\u2019s currently saving up for a second surgery, which will hopefully be very successful, while also paying for her children\u2019s day care.\u00a0 Jessica says that no tax on tips would transform her life.\u00a0 It would make such a big difference.\u00a0\n\nSo, Jessica, we\u2019re going to get that for you.\u00a0 Where are you, Jessica?\u00a0 You\u2019re around here someplace, huh?\u00a0 Hi, Jessica.\u00a0 Oh, so beautiful.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Very nice.\u00a0 It\u2019s working out, medically, good?\u00a0 Everything good?\u00a0 Going to be good.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to.\u00a0 You look fantastic.\u00a0 It\u2019s good.\u00a0 You look great.\u00a0\n\nAlso with us is Lexi York, a 28-year-old cocktail server here at Circa, who\u2019s got big dreams of being an entrepreneur.\u00a0 Lexi says that no tax on tips will help bring those dreams much closer to reach and she\u2019s going to be one of the biggest proponents for it.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a lot of support when we go before Congress very soon to get that passed.\u00a0\n\nLexi, where are you?\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Hi, Lexi.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get it done.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re also pleased to be joined by Rosanna Maietta, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, which strongly supports this pro-worker reform.\u00a0 And, Rosanna, would you like to come up and say a few words on behalf of so many people?\u00a0 Come on up.\u00a0 Come on up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 We love you, Trump!\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\n\nMS. MAIETTA:\u00a0 It\u2019s so nice to meet you.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMS. MAIETTA:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nHello, Mr. President, on behalf of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, I\u2019m so honored to be here today.\u00a0 We represent 30,000 members around the country in an industry that represents more than 2 million hotel workers.\u00a0\n\nAnd I am here to tell you that the American dream is alive and well in the hotel industry today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It is still one of the few places where you can have and grow your career, starting a job as a housekeeper or a dishwasher or bellhop, to running a hotel, to owning a hotel or a few, and to even becoming the CEO of a global brand or president of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nMr. President, in 2017, the tax bill that you championed cut taxes for so many working families and American workers.\u00a0 It helped small businesses \u2014 small bus- \u2014 hotel owners in our country, who make up the majority of the industry, reinvest in the economy, spurring jobs and \u2014 and cur- \u2014 and growing and strengthening the economy.\n\nAnd the no tax on tips builds on that momentum, and so we are so excited to support you in that effort.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u00a0\n\nWe stand with you to urge Congress to pass this proposal so that more than the 800,000 hotel workers who benefit from these \u2014 from tips, many who are here in the room today, representing all \u2014 all types of jobs \u2014 from restaurant workers to housekeepers to bellhops and so many others \u2014 can take home more of the pay that they earn every day.\u00a0\n\nSo, thank you for having us and for promoting this proposal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Well done.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much, ~~Jessica~~ [Rosanna].\u00a0 Great.\u00a0\n\nAfter for you- \u2014 long years \u2014 and these were long years \u2014 of a government that always put you last \u2014 they put America last, they put you last, they put everybody last that was associated with us \u2014 you once again have a president that is putting our workers first, putting our families first, and above all, putting America first, and we\u2019re going to keep America first.\u00a0 And you see it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re restoring our prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re restoring our borders.\u00a0 We\u2019re restoring our strength, our dignity, and our pride.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been hurt badly by this group of people \u2014 this group of people.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t have a clue what the hell was happening.  It\u2019s so disgraceful that they were allowed to do it.\u00a0\n\nBut quite honestly, we\u2019re restoring our country.\u00a0 Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency at our southern border.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I sent active-duty troops to the border to help repel the invasion.\u00a0\n\nTom Homan is leading the charge.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 We like Tom Homan, right?\u00a0 Doing a great job.\u00a0\n\nWe immediately halted all illegal entry and began sending every border trespasser and violator back to the places from which they came.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\n\nI signed an order that will designate the cartels as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s a big deal.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big deal.\u00a0 Biden didn\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0 \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to that.\u201d\u00a0 Biden didn\u2019t know he was alive.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to do it.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0\n\nI always wanted to do it, you know?\u00a0 I mean, think of it.\u00a0 Is that a terrorist organization or what?\u00a0\n\nAnd we began to leverage the full and immense power of federal government and state government and enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to American soil.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t allow people to enter our country and to dump their prisons into the United States of America anymore.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 When we see that, our people are instructed to do whatever they have to do.\u00a0 They can do whatever the hell they want to do.\u00a0\n\nThroughout this week, the heroes of ICE have been hunting down and arresting hundreds of illegal alien criminals.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And it\u2019s immediate expulsion, including those with charges of convictions for rape, child sexual assault, terrorism and even murder.\u00a0\n\nMembers of the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua \u2014 you know that gang?\u00a0 This is not a nice group of people.\u00a0 They formed in prison, and then they dumped their prisons into our country.\u00a0 So, we had them all over the place.\u00a0\n\nAsk Colorado.\u00a0 The governor of Colorado, he doesn\u2019t know what to do about it.\u00a0 They\u2019re all over the place.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get them out.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get them out.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThey\u2019re \u2014 in a sense, they\u2019re in the real estate business.\u00a0 They go into a building, and they take it.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 See, when you buy a building, you have to go out and get a mortgage or use your own cash.\u00a0 They just go into a building and take it.\u00a0\n\nAnd they actually said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not that bad.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t taken that many buildings.\u201d\u00a0 Can you imagine that?\u00a0 \u201cThey haven\u2019t taken that many buildings.\u00a0 Oh, they\u2019re not that bad.\u201d\u00a0 But they\u2019re bad as the bloodthirsty MS-13 gangs that we have gotten thousands and thousands of them out.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, over 11,000 murderers were released into our country by other countries all over the world because of Biden\u2019s open-border policy.\u00a0 When I heard about that, I said, \u201cThey\u2019re just going to \u2014 everybody is going to empty out their prisons into our country.\u201d\u00a0 I said that.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d do that if I were heading up any one of the many countries that you know about.\u00a0 Not just South America, all over \u2014 they take their prisons, their mental institutions and they empty them out into our country.\u00a0 Can you imagine a person doing this?\u00a0 Can you imagine somebody doing that to our country?\n\nFor American citizens, January 20th, 2025, was truly liberation day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That was really liberation day.\n\nThis week, I also signed an order to end the weaponization of our government against American people and political people like me.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We never had a thing like that.\u00a0 He went after his political opponent.\u00a0 Who would have thought he helped me?\u00a0 I think you helped me get elected, Joe, you want to know the truth.\u00a0 I became much more popular \u2014 I\u2019m the only guy that ever became more popular when something like that happened.\u00a0\n\nBut they \u2014 these guys were just so inept.\u00a0 We had the guy Deranged Jack Smith \u2014 deranged.\u00a0 He was a deranged human being.\n\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But they thought this way Biden could sneak by and he could win an election, another \u2014 cheating in another election.\u00a0 That\u2019s what it was.\u00a0 But we won.\u00a0 We won.\u00a0 You think that was fun?\u00a0 You think that was easy?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t fun.\u00a0\n\nAnd investigate all of the abuses of power \u2014 I pardoned hundreds of political prisoners who had been viciously persecuted \u2014 (applause) \u2014 by the Biden regime.\u00a0 Hundreds of people were persecuted, including Christians, pro-life activists, two Washington, D.C., police officers just yesterday, whose lives were destroyed from chasing down a dangerous, illegal alien criminal.\n\nAnd of course, I was very proud to pardon the J6 hostages.\u00a0
