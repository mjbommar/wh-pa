Cardona*, 24-cv-00072 at 73 (E.D. Ky. 2024). *See also**Kansas v. U.S. Dept. of Education*, 24-cv-04041 at 23 (D. Kan. 2024) (highlighting \u201cCongress\u2019 goals of protecting biological women in education\u201d).\u00a0\n\nTherefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.\u00a0 It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women\u2019s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Definitions. \u00a0The definitions in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025 (Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government), shall apply to this order.\n\nSec.3. \u00a0Preserving Women\u2019s Sports in Education. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 In furtherance of the purposes of Title IX, the Secretary of Education shall promptly:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in coordination with the Attorney General, continue to comply with the vacatur of the rule entitled \u201cNondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance\u201d of April 29, 2024, 89 FR 33474, *see Tennessee v. Cardona*, 24-cv-00072 at 13-15 (E.D. Ky. 2025), and take other appropriate action to ensure this regulation does not have effect;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0take all appropriate action to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms and thereby provide the equal opportunity guaranteed by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, including enforcement actions described in subsection (iii); to bring regulations and policy guidance into line with the Congress\u2019 existing demand for \u201cequal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes\u201d by clearly specifying and clarifying that women\u2019s sports are reserved for women; and the resolution of pending litigation consistent with this policy; and\n\n(iii) \u00a0prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions (including athletic associations composed of or governed by such institutions) that deny female students an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them, in the women\u2019s category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males.\n\n(b) \u00a0All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Department of Justice shall provide all necessary resources, in accordance with law, to relevant agencies to ensure expeditious enforcement of the policy established in this order.\u00a0\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Preserving Fairness and Safety in Women\u2019s Sports*.* \u00a0Many sport-specific governing bodies have no official position or requirements regarding trans-identifying athletes. \u00a0Others allow men to compete in women\u2019s categories if these men reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of \u201csincerely held\u201d gender identity. \u00a0These policies are unfair to female athletes and do not protect female safety. \u00a0To address these concerns, it is hereby ordered:\n\n(a) \u00a0The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall, within 60 days of the date of this order:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 convene representatives of major athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by such policies, to promote policies that are fair and safe, in the best interests of female athletes, and consistent with the requirements of Title IX, as applicable; and\n\n(ii)\u00a0 convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women to participate in sports and educate them about stories of women and girls who have been harmed by male participation in women\u2019s sports.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary of State, including through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs\u2019 Sports Diplomacy Division and the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, shall:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 rescind support for and participation in people-to-people sports exchanges or other sports programs within which the relevant female sports category is based on identity and not sex; and\n\n(ii)\u00a0 promote, including at the United Nations, international rules and norms governing sports competition to protect a sex-based female sports category, and, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, convene international athletic organizations and governing bodies, and female athletes harmed by policies that allow male participation in women\u2019s sports, to promote sporting policies that are fair, safe, and in furtherance of the best interests of female athletes.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall review and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women\u2019s sports, and shall issue guidance with an objective of preventing such entry to the extent permitted by law, including pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)).\n\n(d) \u00a0The Secretary of State shall use all appropriate and available measures to see that the International Olympic Committee amends the standards governing Olympic sporting events to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women\u2019s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n(d) \u00a0If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 February 5, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "The issue addressed here revolves around an executive order dated February 5, 2025, aimed at keeping men out of women\u2019s sports in the United States. The order emphasizes  the importance of protecting women and girls' opportunities for fair competition in sports. Citing Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, the order states that educational institutions receiving federal funds should not allow men to compete in women\u2019s sports, as it undermines the safety, fairness, and dignity of female athletes.\n\nKey actions outlined include a directive for the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, to take measures to ensure compliance with Title IX by prioritizing enforcement actions against institutions that allow male participation in female sports. The executive order also mandates the review and possible rescission of federal funding for educational programs not adhering to these guidelines.\n\nOn an international level, the order instructs the Secretary of State to promote sex-based female sports categories and to review U.S. immigration policies concerning male athletes seeking to compete in women\u2019s categories. Overall, this executive order aims to establish a clear federal stance against male participation in women\u2019s sports, citing both legal precedents and the intention to protect biological women\u2019s rights in sports.",
