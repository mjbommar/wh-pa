  "summary": "# Summary\n\nPresident Trump has outlined his America First priorities, focusing on security, economic, governmental, and cultural reforms. He emphasizes actions to make the U.S. safer by tightening border security, reinstituting previous policies such as \"Remain in Mexico,\" ending catch-and-release, and involving the military in border security. Trump plans to designate certain drug cartels as terrorist organizations and enforce stricter criminal penalties.\n\nOn the economic front, President Trump aims to make the U.S. energy dominant by rescinding what he considers climate extremist policies. He intends to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, reduce living costs, and implement an America First Trade Policy. The focus is on reducing dependence on foreign organizations and maintaining low energy costs domestically. \n\nThe reform of the federal government, termed \"Drain the Swamp,\" involves halting the hiring of certain bureaucrats, increasing accountability, and prohibiting government weaponization against political foes. Culturally, Trump plans to protect traditional gender roles and enshrine American landmarks.\n",
