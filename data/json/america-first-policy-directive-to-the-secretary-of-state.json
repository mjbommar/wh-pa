  "summary": "### Summary\nOn January 20, 2025, a Presidential directive was issued outlining a strategic shift towards an 'America First' foreign policy. The directive is designed to align the U.S. Department of State's policies, programs, and operations to prioritize core American interests, emphasizing the welfare of the country and its citizens. This strategic pivot mandates the Secretary of State to guide the department in implementing this America-centric approach at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThe directive also includes general provisions to clarify its implementation. It asserts that nothing in this order should contravene existing legal authorities granted to executive departments or the functions managed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget regarding fiscal, administrative, or legislative activities. Additionally, its implementation is subject to applicable laws and the availability of funds. The order does not establish any legal rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its representatives.",
  "eli5": "The President told people in charge of U.S. foreign affairs that from now on, they have to think about what's best for America first when making decisions.",
