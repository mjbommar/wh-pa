The statement emphasized that the economic state under President Biden was worse than anticipated. This served as a justification for the current economic strategies of President Trump. \n\nPresident Trump has initiated several measures to address the economic challenges cited in the report. He has declared a national energy emergency, aimed at making America energy dominant again. Furthermore, he has committed to reducing regulations by cutting 10 regulations for every new one implemented, along with proposing the largest tax cut in history to benefit working Americans. Trump\u2019s administration positions these efforts as steps towards revitalizing the economy and fostering job creation.",
