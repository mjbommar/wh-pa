Zabavsky had been convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violating sections 371 and 1512 of title 18 of the United States Code. These convictions resulted in a sentence of 48 months of imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently, along with three years of supervised release and a special assessment of $200.\n\nBy utilizing his powers under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution, President Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Zabavsky.
