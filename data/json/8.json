  "summary": "The White House website features a list of presidential actions dated January 20, 2025, detailing the executive measures taken by the President on that day. These actions address a range of topics including accountability for former government officials related to election interference, and restoring accountability to policy-making roles within the federal workforce. Additionally, there are directives concerning the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization and the enforcement of laws against foreign adversary-controlled applications such as TikTok. \n\nFurther actions include granting pardons and commuting sentences for certain offenses linked to the U.S. Capitol events on January 6, 2021, promoting American interests in international environmental agreements, and delivering emergency price relief to combat the cost-of-living crisis. The list also includes a hiring freeze, a regulatory freeze pending review, and a directive for federal employees to return to in-person work. Each action has a dedicated link leading to more detailed information on the White House website.",
