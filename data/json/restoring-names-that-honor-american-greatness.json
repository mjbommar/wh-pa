vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\n\nSection 1.\u00a0 Purpose and Policy.\u00a0 It is in the national interest to promote the extraordinary heritage of our Nation and ensure future generations of American citizens celebrate the legacy of our American heroes.\u00a0 The naming of our national treasures, including breathtaking natural wonders and historic works of art, should honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans in our Nation\u2019s rich past.\u00a0\n\nSec. 2.\u00a0 Appointments to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Within seven days of the date of this order, each agency head with authority to appoint members to the Board on Geographic Names (Board) pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 364a, shall review their respective appointees and consider replacing those appointees in accordance with applicable law.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Interior shall review and consider additional appointments to the Board to assist in fulfilling all aspects of this order, subject to all applicable laws.\n\n(c)\u00a0 With respect to all applications for naming and renaming submitted to the newly constituted Board, the Board shall advance the policy established in section 1 of this order to honor the contributions of visionary and patriotic Americans and may update its principles, policies, and procedures as needed to achieve this policy.\n\n(d)\u00a0 Where Congressional action is required to establish a renaming in public law, following Board approval on renaming, the Board shall provide guidance to all relevant Federal agencies to use the Board-approved name in the interim in federal documents and achieve consistency across the federal government.\n\nSec. 3.\u00a0 Renaming of Mount McKinley.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States, heroically led our Nation to victory in the Spanish-American War.\u00a0 Under his leadership, the United States enjoyed rapid economic growth and prosperity, including an expansion of territorial gains for the Nation.\u00a0 President McKinley championed tariffs to protect U.S. manufacturing, boost domestic production, and drive U.S. industrialization and global reach to new heights.\u00a0 He was tragically assassinated in an attack on our Nation\u2019s values and our success, and he should be honored for his steadfast commitment to American greatness.\n\nIn 1917, the country officially honored President McKinley through the naming of North America\u2019s highest peak.\u00a0 Yet after nearly a century, President Obama\u2019s administration, in 2015, stripped the McKinley name from federal nomenclature, an affront to President McKinley\u2019s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice.\n\nThis order honors President McKinley for giving his life for our great Nation and dutifully recognizes his historic legacy of protecting America\u2019s interests and generating enormous wealth for all Americans.\n\n(b)\u00a0 Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, reinstate the name \u201cMount McKinley.\u201d\u00a0 The Secretary shall subsequently update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.\u00a0 The national park area surrounding Mount McKinley shall retain the name Denali National Park and Preserve.\n\n(c)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Interior shall work with Alaska Native entities and state and local organizations to adopt names for landmarks to honor the history and culture of the Alaskan people.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 Gulf of America.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 The area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico has long been an integral asset to our once burgeoning Nation and has remained an indelible part of America.\u00a0 The Gulf was a crucial artery for America\u2019s early trade and global commerce.\u00a0 It is the largest gulf in the world, and the United States coastline along this remarkable body of water spans over 1,700 miles and contains nearly 160 million acres.\u00a0 Its natural resources and wildlife remain central to America\u2019s economy today.\u00a0 The bountiful geology of this basin has made it one of the most prodigious oil and gas regions in the world, providing roughly 14% of our Nation\u2019s crude-oil production and an abundance of natural gas, and consistently driving new and innovative technologies that have allowed us to tap into some of the deepest and richest oil reservoirs in the world.\u00a0 The Gulf is also home to vibrant American fisheries teeming with snapper, shrimp, grouper, stone crab, and other species, and it is recognized as one of the most productive fisheries in the world, with the second largest volume of commercial fishing landings by region in the Nation, contributing millions of dollars to local American economies.\u00a0 The Gulf is also a favorite destination for American tourism and recreation activities.\u00a0 Further, the Gulf is a vital region for the multi-billion-dollar U.S. maritime industry, providing some of the largest and most impressive ports in the world.\u00a0 The Gulf will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping America\u2019s future and the global economy, and in recognition of this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our Nation\u2019s economy and its people, I am directing that it officially be renamed the Gulf of America.\n\n(b)\u00a0 As such, within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall, consistent with 43 U.S.C. 364 through 364f, take all appropriate actions to rename as the \u201cGulf of America\u201d the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba in the area formerly named as the Gulf of Mexico.\u00a0 The Secretary shall subsequently update the GNIS to reflect the renaming of the Gulf and remove all references to the Gulf of Mexico from the GNIS, consistent with applicable law.\u00a0 The Board shall provide guidance to ensure all federal references to the Gulf of America, including on agency maps, contracts, and other documents and communications shall reflect its renaming.\n\nSec. 5.\u00a0 Additional Action.\u00a0 The Secretary of Interior may solicit public and intergovernmental input regarding additional patriots to honor, particularly in light of America\u2019s semiquincentennial celebration, and shall recommend action to me, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.\n\nSec. 6.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 20, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "The President of the United States issued an order on January 20, 2025, aimed at restoring historical names that honor American contributions and national heritage. The order focuses on updating national landmarks' names to reflect significant American historical figures and events. A particular change cited is restoring the name 'Mount McKinley' for North America's highest peak, previously changed to 'Denali' in 2015. The order also addresses renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' aiming to highlight its value to the U.S. economy and heritage.\n\nTo implement these directives, the order tasks the Secretary of the Interior with updating the Geographic Names Information System and working with relevant parties, including state and local organizations, to reflect these changes officially. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names will also undergo changes, with agency heads reviewing and possibly replacing current appointees to align with the new policy priorities. This order also includes provisions for further actions to recognize more American patriots, especially in anticipation of the semiquincentennial celebration of the United States.",
