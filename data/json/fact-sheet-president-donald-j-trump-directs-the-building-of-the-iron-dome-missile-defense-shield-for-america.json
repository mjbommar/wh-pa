Trump Directs the Building of the Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield for America\t\t\t\t\n\nJanuary 27, 2025\n\n**DEFEND THE UNITED STATES AGAINST MISSILE ATTACK**: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to Build the Iron Dome for America.\n    - The Executive Order directs implementation of a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.       - With the goal of providing for the common defense of American citizens, this Order accelerates the development and deployment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers, proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.\n      - It also secures the supply chains for all components of the Iron Dome. \n    - The Executive Order directs a review of theater missile defense posture to defend United States troops deployed abroad and an increase in cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations with partners and allies.\u00a0\n\n**ADDRESSING VULNERABILITIES BY MODERNIZING AN OUTDATED SYSTEM**:\n    - The threat of attack by ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles remains a catastrophic threat facing the United States.\n    - Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons\u2014including hypersonic\u2014has become more complex with the development of next-generation delivery systems by our adversaries.\n    - Notwithstanding this increasing threat, United States homeland missile defense policy has been limited to staying ahead of rogue nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches.\n\n**THE IRON DOME WILL FURTHER THE GOALS OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH**: By empowering the United States with a second-strike capability, the Iron Dome will deter adversaries from attacks on the homeland.\n    - President Trump is fulfilling his promises: \u201cI will direct our military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the USA.\u201d\n",
  "summary": "On January 27, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to begin the construction of an advanced missile defense system known as the Iron Dome for America. This executive directive focuses on shielding the United States from ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missile threats. The initiative aims to advance the nation's defense capabilities by developing and deploying various space-based and missile interception technologies and ensuring the security of supply chains for all components of the system. The plan includes modernizing current defense systems and enhancing cooperation with global allies in missile defense.\n\nThe Executive Order also mandates a review of the US theater missile defense posture for American troops stationed abroad and seeks to enhance coordination with international partners in missile defense technology and operations. This effort addresses the growing complexity and threat posed by next-generation strategic weapons and aims to provide the US with a credible deterrent capability. This action is framed as a move to strengthen national security and fulfill the promise of building the Iron Dome locally within the United States.",
