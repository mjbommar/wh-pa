Consumer Financial Protection Bureau*, 591 U.S. 197, 203 (2020).\u00a0 \u201cBecause no single person could fulfill that responsibility alone, the Framers expected that the President would rely on subordinate officers for assistance.\u201d\u00a0 *Id.* at 203\u201304.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe President\u2019s power to remove subordinates is a core part of the Executive power vested by Article II of the Constitution and is necessary for the President to perform his duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d \u00a0Because SES officials wield significant governmental authority, they must serve at the pleasure of the President.\u00a0\n\nOnly that chain of responsibility ensures that SES officials are properly accountable to the President and the American people. \u00a0If career SES officials fail to faithfully fulfill their duties to advance the needs, policies, and goals of the United States, the President must be able to rectify the situation and ensure that the entire Executive Branch faithfully executes the law.\u00a0 For instance, SES officials who engage in unauthorized disclosure of Executive Branch deliberations, violate the constitutional rights of Americans, refuse to implement policy priorities, or perform their duties inefficiently or negligently should be held accountable.\u00a0\n\nThe President must be able to trust that the Executive Branch will work together in service of the Nation. \u00a0My Administration will restore a \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d \u00a0Therefore:\u00a0\n\n(a) \u00a0Within 30 days of the signing of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall issue SES Performance Plans that agencies must adopt;\n\n(b) \u00a0Agency heads, who along with their senior staff manage career SES officials as one of their core functions, shall use all available authorities to reinvigorate the SES system and prioritize accountability;\n\n(c) \u00a0Each agency head shall, as necessary and appropriate and consistent with the procedural requirements of section 3395 of title 5, United States Code, reassign agency SES members to ensure their knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission assignments are optimally aligned to implement my agenda; \u00a0\n\n(d) \u00a0Each agency head should terminate its existing Executive Resources Board (ERB), institute a new or interim ERB, and assign senior noncareer officials to chair and serve on the board as a majority alongside career members;\n\n(e) \u00a0Each agency head should terminate its existing Performance Review Board membership and re-constitute membership with individuals committed to full enforcement of SES performance evaluations that promote and assure an SES of the highest caliber; and\n\n(f) \u00a0Any agency head who becomes aware of an SES official whose performance or continued occupancy of the position is inconsistent with either the principles reaffirmed in this Order or their duties to the Nation under section 3131 of title 5, United States Code, shall immediately take all appropriate actions, up to and including removal of that official, with the support of OPM and OMB. \u00a0Restoring an accountable government workforce is a top priority of my Administration.\n",
