  "summary": "**President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 19, 2025, aimed at reducing the Federal Government's size and eliminating wasteful bureaucracy.** The order seeks to enhance accountability, reduce unnecessary governmental entities and advisory committees, and promote innovation. A list of additional entities and committees to be terminated must be submitted to the President within 30 days. This continues the administration's overarching goal of minimizing government overreach, consistent with efforts to reduce the federal footprint. \n\n**The order falls in line with President Trump\u2019s policy of returning power to local communities and state governments**, enhancing government accountability to taxpayers. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) plays a crucial role by identifying billions in waste, fraud, and abuse. The order has been portrayed as a crucial step in fulfilling the President's promise to streamline the Federal Government, by cutting duplicative programs and focusing on priorities that align with American values. Measures include pausing certain foreign aid and launching a deregulation initiative that ensures every new rule is justified by clear benefits.",
