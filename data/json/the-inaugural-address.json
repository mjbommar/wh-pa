EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Thank you very, very much.Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.\u00a0 We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.\u00a0 During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0Our sovereignty will be reclaimed.\u00a0 Our safety will be restored.\u00a0 The scales of justice will be rebalanced.\u00a0 The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.\u00a0 (Applause.)America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.\u00a0 A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\u00a0\u00a0But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.\u00a0 While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\u00a0As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust.\u00a0 For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\u00a0\u00a0We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\u00a0It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\u00a0\u00a0We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\u00a0Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina \u2014 who have been treated so badly \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.\u00a0 They\u2019re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country \u2014 some of whom are sitting here right now.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have a home any longer.\u00a0 That\u2019s interesting.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t let this happen.\u00a0 Everyone is unable to do anything about it.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to change.\u00a0We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\u00a0\u00a0And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves \u2014 in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.\u00a0 All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\u00a0 (Applause.)My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.\u00a0 From this moment on, America\u2019s decline is over.\u00a0 (Applause.)Our liberties and our nation\u2019s glorious destiny will no longer be denied.\u00a0 And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America\u2019s government.\u00a0Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I\u2019ve learned a lot along the way.\u00a0The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one \u2014 that, I can tell you.\u00a0 Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\u00a0Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin\u2019s bullet ripped through my ear.\u00a0 But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.\u00a0 I was saved by God to make America great again.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.\u00a0 We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\u00a0For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\u00a0\u00a0As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.\u00a0 And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.\u00a0 We set records, and I will not forget it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\u00a0Today is Martin Luther King Day.\u00a0 And his honor \u2014 this will be a great honor.\u00a0 But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.\u00a0 We will make his dream come true.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.\u00a0 In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.\u00a0 We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.\u00a0 Can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 (Applause.)Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders.\u00a0 With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.\u00a0 It\u2019s all about common sense.\u00a0 (Applause.)First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.\u00a0 (Applause.)All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\u00a0 We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy.\u00a0 (Applause.)I will end the practice of catch and release.\u00a0 (Applause.)And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\u00a0 (Applause.)And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.\u00a0 We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.\u00a0 We will drill, baby, drill.\u00a0 (Applause.)America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have \u2014 the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth \u2014 and we are going to use it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use it.\u00a0 (Applause.)We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\u00a0With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.\u00a0 (Applause.)In other words, you\u2019ll be able to buy the car of your choice.We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.\u00a0 And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.\u00a0 We did tremendously with their vote.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.\u00a0 Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\u00a0 (Applause.)For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.\u00a0 It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.\u00a0The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\u00a0\u00a0To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency.\u00a0 (Applause.)After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\u00a0 (Applause.)Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents \u2014 something I know something about.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We will not allow that to happen.\u00a0 It will not happen again.Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\u00a0 (Applause.)And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.\u00a0 (Applause.)This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay.\u00a0 (Applause.)And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to end immediately.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America\u2019s enemies.\u00a0 (Applause.)Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.\u00a0 We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end \u2014 and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.I\u2019m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you.America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\u00a0A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\u00a0 (Applause.)President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent \u2014 he was a natural businessman \u2014 and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates \u2014 the United States \u2014 I mean, think of this \u2014 spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\u00a0We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama\u2019s promise to us has been broken.\u00a0The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.\u00a0 American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.\u00a0 And that includes the United States Navy.And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.\u00a0 And we didn\u2019t give it to China.\u00a0 We gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u00a0 (Applause.)Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history\u2019s greatest civilization.\u00a0So, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.\u00a0 We will not be deterred.\u00a0 Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\u00a0\u00a0The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation \u2014 one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\u00a0\u00a0And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\u00a0 (Applause.)Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other.\u00a0 There\u2019s no nation like our nation.Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.\u00a0 The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.\u00a0 The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\u00a0Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.\u00a0 No one comes close.Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.\u00a0 They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.\u00a0 If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\u00a0\u00a0Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.\u00a0 But as you see today, here I am.\u00a0 The American people have spoken.\u00a0 (Applause.)I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.\u00a0 In America, the impossible is what we do best.\u00a0 (Applause.)From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\u00a0\u00a0They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\u00a0\u00a0Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\u00a0After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history.\u00a0 With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love \u2014 and we love it so much.\u00a0\u00a0We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.\u00a0 So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to win like never before.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.\u00a0We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.\u00a0 Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\u00a0America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill.\u00a0 We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\u00a0We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.\u00a0 From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\u00a0We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.\u00a0 The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 God bless America.\u00a0 Thank you all.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nEND\u00a0 12:40 P.M.
