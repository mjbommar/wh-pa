EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 Everybody thought I was going to California.\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 I\u2019m stopping in North Carolina first, because they\u2019ve been abused by what\u2019s happened.\u201d\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 It should have been done.\u00a0 It should have been \u2014 a lot of things should have happened that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re here.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to fix it out.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re working with the gentleman behind me, and you know who they are.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to fix it, and we\u2019re going to fix it as fast as you can.\u00a0 It\u2019s a massive amount of damage.\u00a0 FEMA has really let us down, let the country down.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault or whose fault it is, but we\u2019re going to take over, and we\u2019re going to do a good job. \u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to assign Mr. Whatley \u2014 who\u2019s fantastic, frankly \u2014 and the governor and everybody else that\u2019s going to work.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to supply the money \u2014 we\u2019ll supply a lot of the money.\u00a0 Maybe you have to chip in something \u2014 you\u2019ll chip in a little something, like \u2014\n\nGOVERNOR STEIN:\u00a0 We will.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 maybe 25 percent or whatever.\u00a0\n\nBut we\u2019re going to get it done as quickly as we can, and we want to take care of the people of North Carolina.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting.\u00a0 Everybody is talking about California, and that\u2019s a mess.\u00a0 But I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to California until I stop in North Carolina.\u201d\u00a0 So, here we are. \u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to go visit the site, and we\u2019re going to work with probably three of the congressmen \u2014 Republican congressmen \u2014 who\u2019ve been fantastic \u2014 whose areas have been affected, and with Michael Whatley, the governor, and whoever else is \u2014 you know, we decide to get involved.\n\nProbably less FEMA, because FEMA just hasn\u2019t done the job.\u00a0 And we\u2019re looking at the whole concept of FEMA.\u00a0 I like, frankly, the concept: When North Carolina gets hit, the governor takes care of it.\u00a0 When Florida gets hit, the governor takes care of it, meaning the state takes care of it.\n\nTo have a group of people come in from an area that don\u2019t even know where they\u2019re going in order to solve immediately a problem is something that never worked for me.\u00a0 But this is probably one of the best examples of it not working.\u00a0\n\nAnd there\u2019s been some others, like in Louisiana, et cetera.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to be doing something on FEMA that I think most people agree.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d like to see the states take care of disasters.\u00a0 Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019re going to find it a lot less expensive.\u00a0 You\u2019ll do it for less than half, and you\u2019re going to get a lot quicker response.\u00a0\n\nSo, that seems to be the recommendation, but we\u2019ll be making that recommendation over the next couple of weeks.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to go to the site now, and we\u2019re going to figure out a plan \u2014 a plan for really demolition and cleaning, because not a lot has been done.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very disappointed in the Biden administration, but we\u2019re going to make up for lost time.\u00a0\n\nAnd I said I\u2019d do that, and this is about the earliest we could possibly be here, and we\u2019re honored to be here.\u00a0 This has been a great state.\u00a0 They\u2019re great people, and they\u2019ve really been mishandled.\u00a0 But it\u2019s all \u2014 this group is going to be great, and we\u2019re going to get it taken care of.\u00a0\n\nAny questions?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How \u2014 how will you respond \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How will you make those changes to FEMA?\u00a0 Do you do you expect to ask Congress for additional aid for North Carolina and California?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, it will be direct.\u00a0 In other words, the aid will go through us.\u00a0 So, rather than going through FEMA, it will go through us.\u00a0 And I think maybe this is a good place to start, because \u2014 and in all fairness to the governor, in all fairness to everybody else, FEMA was not on the ball, and we\u2019re going to turn it all around.\u00a0\n\nYes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lot \u2014 a lot of Americans think that this is symbolic of what your campaign was all about: America first, putting your prior- \u2014 priorities to Americans, even going to California, where their policies might mo- \u2014 have been one of the biggest reasons why they\u2019ve had these problems.\u00a0 But you\u2019re putting the American people first.\u00a0 Your thoughts on that?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We are.\u00a0 We\u2019re puttin- \u2014 thank you.\u00a0 I like that question.\u00a0 Boy, I want more questions like that.\u00a0 That\u2019s even a statement.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s a good man, that guy, and he\u2019s also a very professional reporter, I have to say.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019re welcome.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, we\u2019re putting America first.\u00a0 We\u2019re putting, in this case, North Carolina and California \u2014 we\u2019re going to do a good job in California.\u00a0 That is a disaster like \u2014 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever seen anything like it, frankly.\u00a0 They say \u201cthe biggest in the history of California.\u201d\u00a0 I think \u2014 has anything bigger than that happened in the whole country ever?\u00a0 It looks like \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say what it looks like, but you know what I\u2019m going to say.\u00a0 It looks like something hit it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And we won\u2019t talk about what hit it, but it is a bad, bad situation.\u00a0\n\nAnd I guess I\u2019m going to meet with some government officials, but, I mean, much more importantly \u2014 and in California, just to revert to it for a second, millions of gallons of water are waiting to be poured down through already the half pipes that are already built.\u00a0 I mean, they\u2019ve been up for 40 years.\u00a0 And about 20 years ago, they turned off the water.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the water that comes from the Pacific Northwest \u2014 some of it comes out of Canada \u2014 and it flows there, and it probably has flowed there for a million years.\u00a0 And they turned it off, and they route out to the Pacific.\u00a0\n\nAnd in the meantime, you don\u2019t have water in the hydrants.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have water in the sprinkler systems.\u00a0 It\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0\n\nAnd everyone\u2019s trying to figure out: Why aren\u2019t they turning it back?\u00a0 They say it\u2019s the delta smelt \u2014 it\u2019s a fish \u2014 but I find that hard to believe.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what you are \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 figure it out.\u00a0 And without \u2014 and without doing that, you\u2019re going to continue to have problems.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what are you prepared to do, sir, if OPEC doesn\u2019t respond to your call to cut oil prices?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we want to see OPEC cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the tragedy that\u2019s taking place in Ukraine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a butchering tragedy for both sides, by the way.\u00a0 A tremendous number of Russian soldiers are dead; a tremendous number of Ukrainian soldiers, and a lot of people are dead from the bombing of the cities.\u00a0\n\nBut right now, it\u2019s just bullets whacking and hitting men \u2014 mostly men \u2014 almost in all cases, men.\u00a0 And they\u2019re \u2014 over a million men are killed, and they\u2019re lo- \u2014 they\u2019re losing thousands of people a week.\u00a0 It\u2019s crazy.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a crazy war, and it never would have happened if I was president.\u00a0 Would never have happened.\u00a0 This is crazy that it happened, but we want to stop it.\n\nNow, one way to stop it quickly is for OPEC to stop making so much money and to drop the price of oil, because they have it nice and high.\u00a0 And if you have it high, that war is not going to end so easily.\u00a0\n\nSo, OPEC ought to get on the ball, and they ought to drop the price of oil, and that war will stop right away.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you withhold funding to Los Angeles because of its sanctuary city policy?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I want to see two things in Los Angeles:\u00a0 Voter ID, so that the people have a chance to vote, and I want to see the water be released and come down into Los Angeles and throughout the state.\u00a0 Those are the two things.\n\nAfter that, I will be the greatest president that California have ever \u2014 has ever seen.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will there \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I want the water to come down and come down to Los Angeles and also go out to all the farmland that\u2019s barren and dry.\u00a0\n\nYou know, they have land that they say is the equivalent of the land in Iowa, which is about as good as there is anywhere on Earth.\u00a0 The problem is it\u2019s artificial, because they artificially stop the water from going on to the land.\u00a0\n\nSo, I want two things.\u00a0 I want voter ID for the people of California, and they all want it.\u00a0 Right now, you have no \u2014 you don\u2019t have voter ID.\u00a0 People want to have voter identification.\u00a0 You want to have proof of citizenship.\u00a0 Ideally, you have one-day voting, but I just want voter ID as a start.\u00a0 And I want the water to be released, and they\u2019re going to get a lot of help from the U.S.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you in a little while.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will there be (inaudible) \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll see you at the site.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will there \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll see you at the site.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you tell us more about the deportation flights? \u00a0Where are they going from?\u00a0 Where \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s going very well.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 are they going to?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Deportation is going very well.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting the bad, hard criminals out.\u00a0 These are murderers.\u00a0 These are people that have been as bad as you get, as bad as anybody you\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking them out first.\u00a0\n\nThank you.\n\nEND \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11:15 A.M.
