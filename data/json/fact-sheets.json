  "summary": "The document lists several fact sheets released by the former U.S. President Donald J. Trump in January 2025. These fact sheets cover a variety of topics concerning presidential actions and policies. Key actions include enforcing policies to stop taxpayer funding of abortion, enhancing America's leadership in artificial intelligence, establishing leadership in digital financial technology, and launching a council to advance American science and technology. Trump also ordered the declassification of files related to the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK and directed efforts to recognize the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nFurther actions highlight Trump's re-designation of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization and declaring a national emergency at the southern border. The documents also describe measures taken to protect the country by controlling illegal immigration via a proclamation and delivering emergency price relief for American families affected by the cost-of-living crisis. These fact sheets document actions and executive orders taken by Trump during his presidency to address a spectrum of national and international issues.",
