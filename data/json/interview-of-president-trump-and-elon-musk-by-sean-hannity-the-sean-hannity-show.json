MUSK:\u00a0 Because, I mean, the president has been so \u2014 so unfairly attacked in the media.\u00a0 It\u2019s truly outrageous.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve sp- \u2014 at this point, spent a lot of time with the president, and not once have I seen him do something that was mean or cruel or \u2014 or wrong.\u00a0 Not once.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know, I\u2019ve known him for 30 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And we\u2019ve discussed this.\u00a0 And I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do you deal with it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did have a choice?\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, you would say that to me.\u00a0 I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat \u2014 what am I going to do?\u00a0 Worry about it?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s the only thing I can say.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, you know \u2014 and then culminating in two assassination attempts, which resulted in your endorsement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Well, I was going to do it anyway, but that was \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was it?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 \u2014 a precipitating event, yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That speeded it up a little bit?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The day of the assassination?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Nice.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah, it just \u2014 it sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, with your indulgence, I\u2019m convinced that people only know a little bit about Elon.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think they know everything about Elon, because as I studied for and prepared for this interview, I learned a lot about you that I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 I think people will think about Tesla.\u00a0 Democrats are demonizing you and \u2014 and trying to make the country hate you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just want people to understand you a little bit better, and the person that you\u2019ve gotten to know and have now put a lot of trust in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, you know, just \u2014 let\u2019s go over a little bit of your bio, starting \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Ah, okay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 with PayPal and how you became involved in Tesla and SpaceX and Neuralink \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 This \u2014 this could take a while.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and all these \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 I mean, you know, I \u2014 I think the way you think of me is, like, I\u2019m a technologist and I try to make technologies that improve the world and make life better.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You can show them your shirt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah, and that\u2019s why, like, my t-shirt says \u201ctech support\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 because I\u2019m here to provide the president with \u2014 with technology support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now, that \u2014 that may seem, like, well, is that a silly thing?\u00a0 But actually, it\u2019s a very important thing, because the president will make these executive orders, which are very sensible and good for the country, but then they don\u2019t get implemented, you know?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, if you take the \u2014 for example, all the funding for the migrant hotels, the president issued an executive order: Hey, we need to stop taking taxpayer money and \u2014 and paying for luxury hotels for illegal immigrants \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s crazy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 \u2014 which makes no sense.\u00a0 Like, obviously, people do not want their tax dollars going to \u2014 to fund high-end hotels for \u2014 for illegals.\u00a0 And yet, they were still doing that, even as late as last week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, you know, we went in there, and we were like, \u201cThis is in violation of the presidential executive order.\u00a0 It needs to stop.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So \u2014 so, what we\u2019re \u2014 what we\u2019re doing here is \u2014 is \u2014 one of the biggest functions of the DOGE team is just making sure that the presidential executive orders are actually carried out.\u00a0 And this is \u2014 I just want to point out, this is a very important thing, because the president is the elected representative of the people, so he\u2019s representing the will of the people.\u00a0 And if the bureaucracy is fighting the will of the people and preventing the pres- \u2014 the president from implementing what the people want, then what we live in is a bureaucracy and not a democracy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 You \u2014 you\u2019re both aware \u2014 you have to be keenly aware that the media and \u2014 and the punditry class \u2014 not that \u2014 you know, I think you\u2019ve proven they have no power anymore, because they threw everything they had at you, and they didn\u2019t win.\u00a0 And that was, you know, the New York Times, Washington Post, three networks, every late-night comedy show, two cable channels \u2014 they \u2014 they just threw \u2014 they threw everything \u2014 lawfare, weaponization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And now I see they want you two to start \u2014 they want a divorce.\u00a0 They want you two to start hating each other.\u00a0 And they try \u2014 \u201cOh, President Elon Musk,\u201d for example.\u00a0 You do know that they\u2019re doing that to you?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, I see it all the time.\u00a0 They tried it, then they stopped.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t \u2014 they have many different things of hatred.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Actually, Elon called me.\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou know they\u2019re trying to drive us apart.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know, they said, \u201cWe have breaking news: Donald Trump has ceded control of the presidency to Elon Musk.\u00a0 President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I say \u2014 it\u2019s just so obvious.\u00a0 They\u2019re so bad at it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I used to think they were good at it.\u00a0 They\u2019re actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I\u2019d never be president because I \u2014 I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I could do the greatest things; I get 98 percent bad publicity.\u00a0 I could do \u2014 outside of you and a few of your very good friends.\u00a0 It\u2019s, like, the craziest thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But you know what I have learned, Elon?\u00a0 The people are smart.\u00a0 They get it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 They do, actually.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They get it.\u00a0 They really see what\u2019s happening.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And at the end of this interview, I \u2014 what I would like is, I \u2014 I want people to know the relationship and know more about you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the relationship, Mr. President?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I respect him.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always respected him.\u00a0 I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I\u2019m usually pretty good at this stuff.\u00a0 He did Starlink.\u00a0 He did things that were so advanced and nobody knew what the hell they were.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication.\u00a0 They were wiped out.\u00a0 Those people were \u2014 you know, they had rivers in between \u2014 land that never saw water, all of a sudden, there was a river and a vicious \u2014 like, rapids.\u00a0 People were dying all over.\u00a0 They had no communication.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They said, \u201cDo you know Elon Musk?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 And they didn\u2019t really know I knew him.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cCould you get Starlink?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s, like, the first time I ever heard of it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Starlink?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cA communication system that\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And he \u2014 yeah.\u00a0 And he said \u2014 I called him, and I said, \u201cListen, they really need it.\u201d\u00a0 And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives.\u00a0 He got it immediately.\u00a0 And you can\u2019t get it.\u00a0 I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it.\u00a0 But he got it to him immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t even know he had it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We watch the rocket ships, and we watch Tesla.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby.\u00a0 You grab your baby.\u00a0 It just \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

MUSK:\u00a0 How c- \u2014 why \u2014 why are they reacting like this?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, do you give a flying rip?\u00a0 Number one.\u00a0 And \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Well, I guess we must be \u2014 if we\u2019re the target, we\u2019re doing something right.\u00a0 You know, if \u2014 like, they wouldn\u2019t be complaining so much if they \u2014 we weren\u2019t doing something useful, I think.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What \u2014 all we\u2019re really trying to do here is restore the will of the people through the president.\u00a0 And \u2014 and what we\u2019re finding is there\u2019s an unelected bureaucracy.\u00a0 Speaking of unelected, there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a vast federal bureaucracy that is implacably opposed to the \u2014 the president and the Cabinet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And you look at, say, D.C. voting.\u00a0 It\u2019s 92 percent Kamala.\u00a0 Okay, so we\u2019re in 92 percent Kamala.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like me here either.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 I think about that number a lot.\u00a0 I\u2019m like, 92 percent.\u00a0 That\u2019s, basically, almost everyone.\u00a0 And so \u2014 but if \u2014 but how can you \u2014 if \u2014 if the will of the president is not implemented, and the president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being implemented, and that means we don\u2019t live in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the \u2014 sort of, the thrashing of the bureaucracy as we try to restore democracy and the will of the people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Is this making sense?\u00a0 I mean \u2014 sorry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Y- \u2014 no, of course it does.\u00a0 I mean, to me, if you look at our framers and our founders \u2014 and you\u2019ve really become a student of history, Mr. President, and we\u2019ve ta- \u2014 we\u2019ve had conversations both on air and off air \u2014 and if we talk about constitutional order or transformational change, nobody can argue that what\u2019s happening here is going at the speed of light.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But however, what were the principles of our framers and our founders?\u00a0 They wanted limited government, greater freedom for the people \u2014 and we\u2019ll get to the specific cutting of waste, fraud, and abuse.\u00a0 That \u2014 that is your goal, is it not?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 And my goal was to get great people.\u00a0 And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something \u2014 I knew him a little bit through the White House. Originally, I\u2019d see him around a little bit.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know him before that, and I respected what he did.\u00a0 And he fought hard.\u00a0 You know, he was a \u2014 he was maybe questioned for a while.\u00a0 He was having some difficulties.\u00a0 It was not easy doing what he did.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it\u2019s, you know, beating these big companies that that\u2019s all they do is cars?\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s really amazing the things that he\u2019s done.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t know it as much then as now.\u00a0 I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I wanted great people, and he\u2019s a great person.\u00a0 He\u2019s an amazing person.\u00a0 He\u2019s also a caring person.\u00a0 You know, he uses the word \u201ccare.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, they sign a contract in a government agency, and it has three months.\u00a0 And the guy leaves that signed the contract, and nobody else is there, and they pay the contract for 10 years.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, the guy is getting checks for years and years and years, and he\u2019s telling his family, obviously \u2014 maybe it was crooked, maybe he paid to get the contract, or maybe he paid that they didn\u2019t terminate him.\u00a0 But, you know, we have contracts that go forever, and they\u2019ve been going for years, and they\u2019re supposed to end in three months or five months or two years or something, and they go forever.\u00a0 So, the guy is either crooked \u2014 you know, where he knew this was going to happen \u2014 or he\u2019s crooked because he\u2019s getting payments that he knows he shouldn\u2019t be getting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But they\u2019re finding things like that.\u00a0 They\u2019re finding things far worse than that.\u00a0 And they\u2019re finding billions \u2014 and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of fraud.\u00a0 I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste, and abuse.\u00a0 And he\u2019s doing an amazing job.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And he attracts a young, very smart type of person.\u00a0 I call them high-IQ individuals, and they are.\u00a0 They\u2019re very high Q and \u2014 high IQ.\u00a0 And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people \u2014 you know, the people think they\u2019re going to pull it over.\u00a0 They don\u2019t.\u00a0 These guys are smart, and they love the country.\u00a0 You know, there\u2019s a certain something.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But he uses the word \u201ccare.\u201d\u00a0 So, people have to care.\u00a0 Like, when I bought Air Force One \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Exactly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 I negotiated the price.\u00a0 It was $5.7 billion, and I got it \u2014 I got them down $1.7 billion.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re not building the plane fast enough.\u00a0 I mean, they\u2019re actually in default \u2014 Boeing.\u00a0 They\u2019re supposed to \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When is it \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They\u2019ve been building this thing forever.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the new Air Force One?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

MUSK:\u00a0 Sure.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 That is serious, you know, financial trouble.\u00a0 Or they\u2019re putting bare necessities on credit cards.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019m looking at this and I\u2019m thinking, well, how much \u2014 when we \u2014 when all is said and done, we could have written a check or cut the taxes or fixed our schools \u2014\n\nMR.

MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah, how do we assure people that we\u2019re going to do the right thing, that their \u2014 that their Social Security benefits will be there, that their \u2014 the medical care will be good and s- \u2014 and \u2014 in fact, how do we make it \u2014 ensure that there\u2019s better medical care in the future?\u00a0 How do we improve their benefits?\u00a0 How do we make sure that their Social Security check goes further than it did in the past and not \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get weakened by inflation?\n\nSo, the \u2014 if we \u2014 if we address the \u2014 the massive deficit spending, the sort of \u2014 the \u2014 the waste in the government, then \u2014 then we can actually address inflation.\u00a0\n\nSo, provided the economy grows faster than the money supply, which means you stop the government overspending and the waste, and the output of real useful goods and services exceeds the increase in the money supply, you have no inflation.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 And \u2014 and you also drop the \u2014 the interest payments that people pay, because if the government keeps \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Way too high.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 The \u2014 the reason the interest payments are so high is because the \u2014 the national debt keeps increasing.\u00a0 So, the \u2014 the government is competing for \u2014 to sell debt with \u2014 for \u2014 with \u2014 with the private citizens.\u00a0 This drives up the interest rate.\u00a0\n\nSo, if you have a \u2014 if you have a \u2014 if you cut back on the deficit, you actually have an amazing situation for people, because you get r- \u2014 you get rid of inflation and you drop the interest rates.\u00a0 And that means people\u2019s mortgage payments go down, their credit card payments go down, their car payments go down, their student loans go down.\u00a0 Everything \u2014 their \u2014 their life becomes more affordable and they\u2019re standard of living improves.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How quickly?\u00a0 Because I think people are suffering now.\u00a0 We\u2019re still living under the Biden-Harris economy.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But, Sean, you have states right now \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You have some states that operate that way.\u00a0 They operate as well as any corporation.\u00a0 They really operate well.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Florida.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They have surpluses.\u00a0 They ha- \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Texas is \u2014 has a surplus, for example.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 When they \u2014 when they look at New York and \u2014 and California and some of these places that should have an advantage \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s a big advantage \u2014 or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois; it\u2019s horrible how bad he is \u2014 and they don\u2019t have that advantage.\u00a0\n\nYou know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things.\u00a0 And California has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing- \u2014\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 California has \u2014 has great weather.\u00a0 The most expensive weather on Earth.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But \u2014 but \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I like Florida.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But some states operate the way he\u2019s talking about.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Efficiently.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 When you go into some of these states, you\u2019re going to find very little.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to find almost nothing.\u00a0 They really operate well \u2014 big surpluses, low taxes.\u00a0 And \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know, my taxes went up the first time you were president, because you took away the SALT deduction \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 well, I did.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 which, by the way, I thought was the right decision.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was the right decision \u2014 in fact, Reagan tried to do it \u2014 because it rewards badly run states.\n\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s a tough \u2014 it was \u2014 it\u2019s tough for the states.\u00a0 I mean, it really is tough for the states.\u00a0\n\nThe sad part is it rewards really badly run states.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And Reagan tried to do it.\u00a0 He was unable to do it.\u00a0 I got it done.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You got it done, and \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And now we\u2019re going to give some back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A little bit.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because you know what?\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to help them.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s only a little.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to help.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because otherwi- \u2014 we\u2019re encouraging people to elect high taxes, spen- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Nobody had any idea it would be that devastating.\u00a0 I did the right thing.\u00a0 I got something that Reagan couldn\u2019t do.\u00a0 I got it done, where everybody is \u2014 are the same.\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to help them out.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reagan had the Grace Commission, some of the best business minds in the country.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And they came up with recommendations.\u00a0 Congress adopted none of them, and none of them were implemented.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve got to ask this question, because the media is obsessed about it: What \u2014 what if there is a conflict?\u00a0 In other words, because you do business \u2014 it was funny, when it came out the other day, that there was going to be, I think, $400 million \u2014 billio- \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was millions or billions \u2014 a lot of money on Teslas that Joe Biden\u2019s administration w- \u2014 did with Tesla, and \u2014\n\nMR.
