  "summary": "On January 24, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to reinforce the Hyde Amendment. This amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for elective abortions, aligning with a longstanding legislative consensus. The order highlights the reversal of policies from the previous administration, which had overlooked this precedent by enforcing public funding for such procedures.\n\nThe executive order revokes previous Executive Orders 14076 and 14079, which were related to ensuring reproductive healthcare access. Implementation guidance is to be issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that federal departments and agencies align with the new directive. The order also ensures compliance with existing laws while clarifying that it does not create any enforceable rights.\n\nThe directive emphasizes that it should not interfere with existing authorities of government agencies or the Office of Management and Budget's responsibilities. Compliance is also contingent upon legislative appropriations and does not establish any legal rights against the government.",
