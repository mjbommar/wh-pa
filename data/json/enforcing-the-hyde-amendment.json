  "summary": "### Summary\n\nOn January 24, 2025, a presidential action was taken to reinforce the Hyde Amendment, a policy that has been in place for nearly five decades to prevent the use of federal funds for elective abortions. The current administration aims to revoke actions from previous administrations that contradicted this policy and redirected taxpayer dollars towards funding abortions.\n\nThe presidential order revoked two Executive Orders from 2022 that provided funding for reproductive healthcare services, including elective abortions. It directed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue new guidance to federal agencies to ensure compliance with the Hyde Amendment.\n\nThe directive emphasizes that it should not alter existing legal authorities or the roles of various executive departments, and it clarifies that it does not establish any legally enforceable rights for parties against the U.S. Government.\n",
  "eli5": "*The President said that money from taxes shouldn't be spent to help pay for abortions, so they changed some rules that said it's okay to use that money. Now, they want to make sure this new rule is followed.*",
