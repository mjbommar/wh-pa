Trump Reins in Government Waste\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 26, 2025\n\n**ENSURING EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT COSTS AND CONTRACTS:**Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order Implementing the President\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost efficiency initiative.\n    - The Executive Order will use modern technology to transform Federal spending on contracts and grants by subjecting it to rigorous standards.       - Agencies must immediately review all contracts and grants for waste, fraud, and abuse.       - Government payments and travel expenses must be justified and made publicly available where possible.        - Agency heads will work with the DOGE team leads employed by their agencies to review and terminate all unnecessary contracts. \n    - The Order will reform the way the Federal government manages its real property.       - The General Services Administration (GSA) will submit a plan for disposing of unnecessary government-owned or leased real property. \n\n**BRINGING DISCIPLINE TO A WASTEFUL SYSTEM:** The existing system fails to safeguard taxpayer dollars or promote merit among contractors and grant recipients.\n    - The federal government expends large sums on contracts and grants.       - In fiscal year 2023, the federal government committed about $759 billion on contracts.\u00a0 This flood of spending historically had minimal safeguards. \n    - In the Biden Administration, GSA directed its efforts to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) rather than merit and efficiency.\n\n**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:** President Trump has made cutting federal expenditures and promoting governmental efficiency a priority in his second term.\n    - In his first term, President Trump spurred economic growth through significant regulatory reform.       - The Executive Order\u2019s program for reforming contracting and grantmaking is a natural extension of these efforts to improve government for the American people it serves.\n",
  "summary": "On February 26, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at increasing efficiency within the U.S. government by reducing waste in government contracts and grants. This order initiates the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost efficiency initiative, which mandates federal agencies to review all contracts and grants to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. It also requires agencies to justify government payments and travel expenses, making these details publicly accessible when feasible. The order enlists agency heads to collaborate with DOGE leads to eliminate unnecessary contracts and oversees the improvement of real property management by instructing the General Services Administration (GSA) to propose a plan for disposing of unneeded government properties.\n\nThe initiative seeks to address weaknesses in the existing system that purportedly lacks safeguards to protect taxpayer funds and does not adequately emphasize merit among contractors and grant recipients. This move is a continuation of President Trump's earlier efforts, from his first term, to enhance governmental efficiency through regulatory reforms and aims to build on previous successes in economic growth. In contrast, the previous administration focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, which the Executive Order suggests detracted from merit-based and efficient practices.",
