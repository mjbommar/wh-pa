  "markdown": "[About The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/)\n\n# \t\t\t\t\tThe White House BUILDING\t\t\t\t\n\nOur first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The following year, the cornerstone was laid and a design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife Abigail moved into the still-unfinished residence. During the War of 1812, the British set fire to the President\u2019s House, and James Hoban was appointed to rebuild it. James Monroe moved into the building in 1817, and during his administration, the South Portico was constructed. In 1829, Andrew Jackson oversaw the addition of the North Portico. Various proposals were put forward during the late 19th century to significantly expand the President\u2019s House or to build an entirely new residence, but these plans were never realized.\n\nIn 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt began a major renovation of the White House, including the relocation of the President\u2019s offices from the Second Floor of the Residence to the newly constructed temporary Executive Office Building (now known as the West Wing). The Roosevelt renovation was planned and carried out by the famous New York architectural firm McKim, Mead and White. Roosevelt\u2019s successor, President William Howard Taft, had the Oval Office constructed within an enlarged office wing.\n\nLess than fifty years after the Roosevelt renovation, the White House was already showing signs of serious structural weakness. President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls was dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and in 1952, the Truman family moved back into the White House.\n\nEvery president since John Adams has occupied the White House, and the history of this building extends far beyond the construction of its walls. From the Ground Floor Corridor rooms, transformed from their early use as service areas, to the State Floor rooms, where countless leaders and dignitaries have been entertained, the White House is both the home of the President of the United States and his family, and a living museum of American history. The White House remains a place where history continues to unfold.\n    - There are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels in the Residence. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases, and 3 elevators.\n    - The White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d\u2019oeuvres to more than 1,000.\n    - The White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.\n    - At various times in history, the White House has been known as the \u201cPresident\u2019s Palace,\u201d the \u201cPresident\u2019s House,\u201d and the \u201cExecutive Mansion.\u201d\n    - President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.\n",
  "summary": "### Summary\n\nThe White House, the official residence of the President of the United States, was originally designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban. George Washington selected its site in 1791, and after eight years of construction, President John Adams moved in, despite the building's unfinished state. The structure was set ablaze during the War of 1812 but was later rebuilt by Hoban. Architectural developments during subsequent presidencies included the addition of the South and North Porticos. Plans for further expansion in the 19th century weren't realized.\n\nIn the 20th century, President Theodore Roosevelt initiated major internal renovations, transforming the White House\u2019s office space by creating what is known today as the West Wing. Under President Harry S. Truman, a comprehensive renovation addressed structural weaknesses, preserving only the outer walls. The White House today features 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and significant historical and functional spaces. Over time, it has been labeled in various terms before being officially named the White House in 1901 by President Roosevelt.\n\nThroughout its history, the White House has not only served as the residence for every president since John Adams but has also been a living museum hosting dignitaries and allies. It represents both a symbolic and functional center of the US government, reflecting the architectural, historical, and cultural evolution of the United States.",
  "eli5": "The White House is where the President of the United States lives and works. It has been around for over 200 years, starting with George Washington choosing the spot. It got burned down once but was rebuilt. Lots of important people visit there, and it\u2019s really big with lots of rooms.",
