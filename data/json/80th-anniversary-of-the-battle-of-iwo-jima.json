TRUMP, President of the United\u00a0States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 19, 2025, as the 80th Anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima.\u00a0 I encourage all Americans to remember the selfless patriots of the Greatest Generation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two\u00a0thousand\u00a0twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United\u00a0States of\u00a0America the two\u00a0hundred and forty-ninth.\n",

President Trump also emphasized the strategic impact of the battle and the lasting alliance between the United States and Japan as a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific region.
