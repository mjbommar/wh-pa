Within 30 days from the date of this order, each designated official shall identify any regulatory hurdles that unduly burden each respective water project, identify any recent changes in state or Federal law that may impact such projects from a regulatory perspective (including Public Law 118-5), and shall develop a proposed plan, for review by the Secretaries, to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden such projects and are not necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law.\u00a0 In so doing, each designated federal official will coordinate and share all appropriate information that will enable improved efficiencies.\u00a0 For the purposes of this order, \u201cunduly burden\u201d means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, impede or otherwise impose significant costs on the permitting, utilization, transmission, delivery, or supply of water resources and water infrastructure.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Ending the Subsidization of California\u2019s Mismanagement.\u00a0 (a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall review all Federal programs, projects, and activities for all relevant agencies that impact land management, water availability, water supply, water storage and delivery, water infrastructure, and disaster preparedness and response.\n\n(b) \u00a0Within 30 days of the date of this order, to ensure that State and local jurisdictions promote sensible land management practices and reliable water supply for all Americans, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, regarding California State and local policies or practices inconsistent with sound disaster prevention and response.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall recommend appropriate action to the President, regarding:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0any lack of compliance by California with the terms of existing Federal grants, contracts, or other financial assistance to States or localities;

  "summary": "On January 24, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order in response to devastating wildfires in Southern California, particularly in Los Angeles. These fires have resulted in significant loss of life and property, prompting federal intervention. The order calls for a coordinated effort by several federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Interior, to override state and local policies that hinder effective water resource management. This includes measures to maximize water deliveries and expedite regulatory processes to better manage water supply and fire-related disasters.\n\nThe executive order also outlines additional measures to support affected families, particularly focusing on housing displaced persons and removing debris to facilitate reconstruction efforts. It includes actions for addressing mismanagement of disaster funds in California and similar support for North Carolina, which is recovering from Hurricane Helene. The order emphasizes the need to ensure compliance with federal funding requirements and aims to improve disaster response capabilities for future incidents.\n\nFederal agencies are tasked with identifying and removing regulatory barriers, ensuring compliance with existing laws such as the Endangered Species Act, and coordinating efforts between state and federal entities. The order asserts the federal government's authority to prioritize national interests over conflicting state policies in disaster-affected areas.",
