  "summary": "The document is a page from the White House website listing recent **Presidential Actions** dated January 20, 2025. It includes several key initiatives undertaken by the President to address various national and international concerns. The actions cover topics such as designating cartels and organizations as terrorist entities, reforming the federal hiring process, and ending government DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs perceived as radical and wasteful. Consistency can be seen across all documents as they aim to enhance government efficiency, protect national security, and prioritize American interests.\n\nNotable actions include the establishment of a 'Department of Government Efficiency', protection strategies against foreign terrorists, and the unleashing of Alaska's resource potential. The site also provides navigational links allowing users to browse previous and subsequent news pages. These actions are part of a broader strategy to bolster the country's security, economic resources, and governmental practices.",
  "eli5": "This page explains that the President has ordered many new rules to make the government work better and safer. They also want to make sure America's resources and people are protected.",
