Trump Works to Remake America\u2019s Federal Workforce\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 11, 2025\n\n**REFORMING THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE TO BETTER SERVE AMERICANS:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order implementing the President\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) workforce optimization initiative.\n    - The Executive Order will make the federal workforce more efficient and effective.       - Agency Heads will coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions.        - The Office of Personnel Management will initiate a rulemaking to ensure federal employees are held to the highest standards of conduct. \n    - The Order will significantly reduce the size of government.       - Upon expiration of the Day 1 hiring freeze and implementation of the hiring plan, agencies will be able to hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service (with appropriate immigration, law enforcement, and public safety exceptions).        - Agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren\u2019t required by law. \n    - The Order exempts personnel and functions critical to national security, public safety, law enforcement, and immigration enforcement.\n\n**REDUCING THE UNNECESSARY FOOTPRINT OF GOVERNMENT:**President Donald J. Trump is committed to reducing the size and scope of the federal government.\n    - There are too many federal employees.       - Excluding active-duty military and Postal Service employees, the federal workforce exceeds 2.4 million.        - No one knows exactly how many federal agencies exist, but the Federal Register lists over 400. \n    - The federal workforce contributes significantly to federal spending and debt.       - In fiscal year 2022, the federal government spent nearly $300 billion on compensation for civilian employees, excluding pensions.        - According to a recent congressional report, only 6% of federal workers report to work in-person on a full-time basis. \n\n**BUILDING ON PAST SUCCESS:**President Trump has made reforming the federal workforce a key priority for his second term.\n    - President Trump has consistently worked to shrink the administrative state.\n    - His first term spurred robust economic growth and innovation through regulatory reform.\u00a0\n    - Workforce reform in his second term will build on these successes.\n",
  "summary": "On February 11, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to reform the federal workforce via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. This initiative aims to make the federal workforce smaller and more effective by coordinating with agency heads to limit hiring to essential positions and reducing the workforce size. Certain critical functions and personnel related to national security and public safety are exempt from these reductions. The Office of Personnel Management is tasked with introducing regulations to uphold high conduct standards among federal employees.\n\nThe Executive Order includes measures to significantly reduce the federal government footprint by controlling spending and debt associated with federal employees. Trump aims to shrink federal employment numbers, noting over 2.4 million employees outside of active-duty military and postal workers. A hiring plan proposes allowing only one hire for every four employees departing, excluding vital roles. This approach is driven by the belief that reducing the number of federal agencies, currently over 400 according to the Federal Register, is crucial.\n\nPresident Trump continues to prioritize workforce reform as part of his second-term agenda, building on economic growth and innovation strategies from his first term. The focus remains on minimizing administrative overhead and the unnecessary expansion of federal responsibilities, showcasing Trump's ongoing commitment to streamline government operations.",
