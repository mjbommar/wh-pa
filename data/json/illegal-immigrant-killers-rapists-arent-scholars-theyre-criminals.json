  "summary": "On February 26, 2025, a White House article criticized statements by filmmaker Michael Moore, who argued that deporting illegal immigrants could result in lost potential contributions, such as scientific achievements. The White House refuted this by emphasizing the importance of deporting criminals to protect American citizens. The Deputy Press Secretary, Kush Desai, humorously suggested that Moore could witness the scientific advancements supposedly made by criminals back in their countries of origin.\n\nThe article listed several cases of apprehended illegal immigrants involved in serious crimes, ranging from child exploitation and rape to murder and terrorism. These individuals were apprehended in various states, including Philadelphia, North Carolina, and Texas, illustrating the administration's efforts to prioritize the safety of American communities. The piece concluded with a strong assertation of the Trump Administration's commitment to focusing on the wellbeing of U.S. citizens.",
