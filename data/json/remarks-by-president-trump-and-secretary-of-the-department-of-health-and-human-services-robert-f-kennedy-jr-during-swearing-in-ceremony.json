KENNEDY, JR., DURING SWEARING-IN CEREMONY\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 13, 2025\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nOffice of Communications\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nREMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., DURING SWEARING-IN CEREMONY\n\nOval Office(February 13, 2025)\n\n2:45 P.M. EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And thank you all for being here on this very exciting \u2014 this is a very exciting day for \u2014 we just had a big tariff meeting \u2014 reciprocal tariffs.\u00a0 Should have been done 40 years ago.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t, but it is now.\u00a0 It was big moment, actually, and this is a tremendous moment right now.\u00a0\n\nAnd it\u2019s going to be a real honor for me to introduce Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who\u2019ll take the oath of office and officially become our secretary of Health and Human Services, just as I promised last year.\n\nBobby is going to lead a great national mission to make America healthy again, and he\u2019s going to do it.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s going to do things that will really make us very proud of this day.\n\nLike his father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, Bobby has devoted much of his life to serving his fellow Americans.\u00a0 In his campaign for president \u2014 and he was a very tough competitor.\u00a0 I did not like it at all.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I said, \u201cLet\u2019s get him on my side.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nBut in his campaign for president in 2024, Bobby brought together a coalition of supporters across party lines, and he really worked very hard, and he had tremendous support, unbelievable support.\u00a0 And I think a lot of that support came my way when we decided to do a little merger.\u00a0\n\nAnd it was really great.\u00a0 And it was very loyal \u2014 very loyal, incredible people.\u00a0 They believe in him so strongly because he\u2019s a fierce advocate for the health of our children and for the values of free speech, democracy, and peace.\n\nAnd people are going to be very impressed.\u00a0 I have no doubt.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known him a long time.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a friend of mine a long time.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps most importantly, though, Bobby created a nationwide movement made up of millions and millions of mothers and fathers and young people and concerned citizen of every background who want to end this \u2014 this horrible, chronic disease crisis that exists in America.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely committed to getting dangerous chemicals out of our environment and out of our food supply and getting the American people the facts and the answers that we deserve after years in which our public health system has squandered the trust of our citizens.\u00a0 And they really have.\u00a0 They don\u2019t trust us.\u00a0 They don\u2019t trust anybody, frankly.\u00a0 They\u2019ve gone through hell.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s no better person to lead our campaign of historic reforms and restore faith in American health care, and Bobby is going to do it.\u00a0\n\nThe United States spends more money in health than any other country on Earth, but we\u2019re growing sicker every year.\u00a0 We\u2019re not as healthy as countries that spend just a fraction of what we spend.\u00a0 So, there\u2019s something wrong.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to figure it out.\u00a0\n\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve seen staggering increases in cancer rates across all age demographics, including more than 40 percent increase in childhood cancer since 1975 \u2014 who can believe that? \u2014 and an explosion in other chronic childhood illnesses.\u00a0\n\nNot long ago, 1 in 10,000 people \u2014 children had autism.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s 1 in 36.\u00a0 Think of that, 1 in 10,000 \u2014 1 in 10,000, and now it\u2019s 1 in 36.\u00a0 Who can believe that?\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong.\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong, and I think it\u2019s something that can be found out.\n\nIn 2022, more than 40 percent of children had at least one chronic health condition, and today, nearly 80 percent of young adults do not qualify for military service, in large part for health reasons.\u00a0 Think of that, 80 percent.\u00a0 Something is wrong, and that\u2019s why, immediately after Bobby is sworn in, I will be signing an executive order establishing the president\u2019s commission to make America healthy again.\u00a0 We have some great people on that commission.\n\nChaired by our new secretary, this groundbreaking commission will be charged with investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illness, reporting its findings, and delivering an action plan to the American people.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to be a plan that people are really waiting to hear.\u00a0\n\nBobby, I want to thank you.\u00a0 You\u2019ve gone through a lot.\u00a0 It\u2019s taken great courage.\u00a0 You\u2019ve been amazing, actually.\u00a0 I\u2019d call him, I\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\u00a0 And he said, \u201cI know.\u00a0 I really do.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s really been supported, amazingly, by Cheryl and his family.\u00a0 And it was a very tough \u2014 it was a very nasty group of people that were after him, but he was tougher, and he was smarter than they are, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s here today.\u00a0 There are very few people that could have withstood the assault, but he was able to.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, I just want to congratulate you, and we have a very special person here to swear you in.\u00a0 A very \u2014 a man that I think has done just a \u2014 I think he\u2019s just an amazing man, as you know.\u00a0 His name happens to be Gorsuch, and he\u2019s a member of the Supreme Court in extremely good standing.\u00a0 He\u2019s highly respected by everybody.\u00a0And I didn\u2019t know, are you two friends or something or did this just happen to be \u2014 Justice, did this just happen to be the luck of the draw?\u00a0 What happened?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. KENNEDY:\u00a0 I reached out to him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did you reach out?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. KENNEDY:\u00a0 Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, you reached out to a very good man.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, please, if you would.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. SCHARF:\u00a0 Mr. President, you have to sign the commission first.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sorry \u2014 sorry, Justice, we just need to \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 Oh, this has to be done first.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll do this first.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

HINES:\u00a0 No, why am I in it?\u00a0 I\u2019m not \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Go in there.\u00a0 Get the kids in there.\u00a0 Go in there.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MS. HINES:\u00a0 And the \u2014 oh, I\u2019m going to hold it.\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019m holding it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you get in here?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AIDE:\u00a0 Over here, please.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The president, Justice Gorsuch, Secretary Kennedy, and the family of Secretary Kennedy pose for a picture with the signed certificate.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 Would all the family like to join?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Yeah, sure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 Please place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeat after me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. KENNEDY:\u00a0 I, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JUSTICE GORSUCH:\u00a0 Do solemnly swear.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR.

HINES:\u00a0 Oh, Bobby.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 I \u2014 I want to being by thanking President Trump for giving me this extraordinary opportunity, and I \u2014 I want to introduce my family and thank them for being here.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My wife, Cheryl; my cousin, Anthony Shriver; my daughter, Kick; my other daughter, Kyra; Carolina \u2014 Carolina Shriver; Joey Shriver; Jackson Hines; and Amaryllis Kennedy.\u00a0\n\nOh, and I want to thank all of you so \u2014 for your support and throughout this whole two-and-a-half-year journey.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I \u2014 I \u2014 my first time in this Oval Office was in 1961, and I came here to meet my \u2014 or 1962.\u00a0 I came here, and I had a meeting with my uncle, who was president then, where we talked about the environment.\u00a0\n\nHe was involved deeply, as we all know, in restoring physical fitness in this country.\u00a0 He challenged \u2014 at one point during his administration, he challenged Americans to do a 50-mile walk, which I ultimately did.\u00a0\n\nBut I remember the day that my father completed his walk.\u00a0 We were staying at \u2014 at \u2014 up at Camp David.\u00a0 And my father came in after 18 hours walking on the C&amp;O towpath with his feet bleeding and blisters on them.\u00a0\n\nMy father had a \u2014 one of his best friends was Al Lowenstein.\u00a0 And Al Lowenstein ult- \u2014 ultimately \u2014 he was a congressman from New York who was assassinated himself in 1980.\u00a0 But Al Lowenstein had started the \u201cDump Johnson\u201d movement to get rid of President Johnson and \u2014 and end the Vietnam War.\u00a0 And at the time that he started it, people just thought it was a fool\u2019s errand.\u00a0\n\nAnd ultimately, he asked my father to run for president against Johnson.\u00a0 My father wouldn\u2019t do it at that time, and he asked Gene McCarthy.\u00a0 McCarthy did it, and he joined that campaign.\u00a0\n\nAnd my father ultimately ran, and Johnson then dropped out.\u00a0 So, Al Lowenstein had succeeded.\u00a0\n\nAnd although Al Lowenstein was on the other side now running against my father with Gene McCarthy, my father wrote him a note \u2014 a quote from Emerson \u2014 where he said, \u201cIf a single man plants himself firmly on his own ideal, and there abide, the whole wide world will come around to him.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFor 20 years, I\u2019ve gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country.\n\nOn August 23rd of last year, God sent me President Trump, and he gave me \u2014 (applause) \u2014 he\u2019s now given me \u2014 he\u2019s kept every promise that he\u2019s made to me.\u00a0 He\u2019s kept his word in every account and gone way beyond it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m so grateful to you, Mr. President.\u00a0 A lot of people told me that I couldn\u2019t trust President Trump, that I better get it in writing.\u00a0 And we did a handshake, and everything that he told me he was going to do, he has done.\u00a0 And I\u2019m so grateful to him.\u00a0\n\nAnd I\u2019ve told you before, I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal historical figure, and you are going to transform this country at a time when we see all of the indicia of democracy now in tatters in our country.\u00a0 We see the rise of the military-industrial complex, the rise of totalitarianism, these attacks on our Constitution, and this breathtaking epidemic that is disabling our people.\u00a0\n\nPresident Trump has promised to restore the American dream in this country.\u00a0 A healthy person has a thousand dreams.\u00a0 A sick person only has one.\u00a0 Sixty percent of our population has only one dream: that they get better.\n\nPresident Trump has promised that he\u2019s going to restore America\u2019s strength.\u00a0 But we can\u2019t be a strong nation if we have a weak citizenry.\u00a0 If people are sick \u2014 60 percent of our \u2014 our people are sick.\u00a0 Seventy-seven percent, as President Trump mentioned, of our children cannot qualify for military service.\n\nAnd pr- \u2014 we need a man on a white horse now.\u00a0 We need somebody who \u2014 who is willing to come in and has the spine and the guts and the strength to challenge orthodoxies, to stand in the way of vested interests, and to break institutions that have turned against our democracy.\u00a0 President Trump has shown again and again that he is that hero.\u00a0\n\nAnd most recently, I gre- \u2014 greatly appreciate, and I called you the day that you announced the termination of USAID.\u00a0 My uncle started USAID in 1961 for humanitarian purposes, to put our country on the side of the poor.\u00a0 It has been captured by the military-industrial complex.\u00a0 It has become a sinister propagator of totalitarianism across \u2014 and war across the globe, and very few people understand how sinister this agency really is.\u00a0 And President Trump saw that, and he stood up to it with a master stroke.\n\nAnd we want to do the same thing with the institutions that are stealing the health of our children.\u00a0 We need a revolutionary figure, and you are that figure.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very grateful for you for giving me this opportunity.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Bobby.\u00a0\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 I want to \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I just \u2014 I want to recognize some of the \u2014 the allies that I\u2019ve had in this battle for a long time: Ra- \u2014 Senator Rand Paul; Senator Ron Johnson; Senator Roger Marshall; Marjorie Taylor Greene; and \u2014 and Buddy Carter, who have all been champions of the MAHA agenda before I even came along.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful for you for standing strong.\u00a0\n\nThank you very much, President Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, if I could ask, what plans do you have immediately at HHS now that you\u2019re sworn in, sir?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be running it.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to do a great job.\u00a0 That\u2019s my plan.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What would you like to see him to do first, Mr. President?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, he\u2019s going to find out a lot of secrets that have been maybe kept from us, but he\u2019s going to come up with some solutions to some big, big problems \u2014 solve problems.\u00a0 And I think he\u2019s going to go down in the record books.\u00a0 I really have confidence.\u00a0 This group has great co- \u2014 even Rand has confidence, and that\u2019s \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 that doesn\u2019t happen often.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\n(Inaudible) good luck.\u00a0 Good luck.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I could ask you, Mr. Secretary, do you plan to fire anyone immediately?\u00a0 Or what are your plans on day one, which I guess is today?\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 Our plans are radical transparency and returning gold-standard science to NIH, to the FDA, and CDC \u2014 to end \u2014 ending the corruption, ending the corporate capture of those agencies, getting rid of the people on those panels that have conflicts of interest.\u00a0 We can do unadorned and unimpeded science, rather than the kind of product that is coming out of those agencies today.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Secretary, may I ask, how do you address concerns that some Americans may have about your stance on vaccines?\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 If \u2014 when people actually hear what I think about vaccines, which is common sense \u2014 which is vaccines should be tested, they should be safe, everybody should have informed consent \u2014 people \u2014 people are reacting because they hear things about me that aren\u2019t true.\u00a0 They hear characterizations of things that I\u2019ve said that are simply not true.\u00a0\n\nWhen they hear what I have to say, actually, about vaccines, everybody supports it.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Kennedy, Cara Castronuova from Lindell TV.\u00a0 What\u2019s your message to Democrats in the Senate that
