of the agency\u2019s covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification for each payment submitted by the agency employee who approved the payment.\u00a0 This system shall include a mechanism for the Agency Head to pause and rapidly review any payment for which the approving employee has not submitted a brief, written justification within the technological system.\u00a0\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0Once the system described in subsection (a) of this section is in place, the Agency Head shall issue guidance, in consultation with the agency\u2019s DOGE Team Lead, to require that the

place, the Agency Head shall prohibit agency employees from engaging in federally funded travel for conferences or other non-essential purposes unless the travel-approving official has submitted a\u00a0brief, written justification for the federally funded travel within such system. \u00a0Each DOGE Team Lead shall, to the extent consistent with law, provide the Administrator with a monthly

  "summary": "# Implementing the President's Cost Efficiency Initiative\n\nOn February 26, 2025, a new executive order was issued by the President of the United States to implement the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-saving measures across federal agencies. The executive order mandates a thorough review and transformation of federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to enhance transparency and accountability. This initiative requires the creation of centralized technological systems within agencies for recording and justifying payments under federal contracts and grants.\n\nThe initiative outlines specific actions for agency heads, including pausing payments that lack written justification, reviewing existing contracts and grants to reduce or redistribute spending, and implementing approval processes for new contracts. Additional measures involve scrutinizing non-essential travel expenses and freezing credit card use for a period. A focus is placed on real property disposition, including updating inventory records and reassessing government property leases. The order sets exceptions primarily for law enforcement, military, and other critical services.",
