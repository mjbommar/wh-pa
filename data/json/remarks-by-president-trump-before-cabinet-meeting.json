EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 We appreciate you being here.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve put together a great Cabinet.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had tremendous success.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been given a lot of credit for having a very successful first month, and we want to make that many months \u2014 and years, actually.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to have many good months, and we\u2019re going to have many good years, I hope.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to solve a lot of problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very well with Russia-Ukraine.\u00a0 President Zelenskyy is going to be coming on Friday.\u00a0 It\u2019s now confirmed.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be signing an agreement, which will be a very big agreement.\u00a0 And I want to thank Howard and Scott for the job you guys did in putting it together.\u00a0 Really did an amazing job.\u00a0 And that\u2019ll be on rare earth and other things.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And as you know, we\u2019re in for, probably, $350 billion and Europe is in for $100 billion.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a big difference.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re in for, probably, three times as much.\u00a0 And yet, it\u2019s very important to everybody, but Europe is very close.\u00a0 We have a big ocean separating us.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s very important for Europe.\u00a0 And they, hopefully, will step up and do maybe more than they\u2019re doing and maybe a lot more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The previous administration put us in a very bad position, but we\u2019ve been able to make a deal where we\u2019re going to get our money back and we\u2019re going to get a lot of money in the future.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s appropriate, because we have taxpayers that are \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be footing the bill, and they shouldn\u2019t be footing the bill at more than the Europeans are paying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, it\u2019s all been worked out.\u00a0 We\u2019re happy about it.\u00a0 And I think that, very importantly, we\u2019re going to be able to make a deal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most importantly, by far, we\u2019re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.\u00a0 They\u2019ll stop killing young Russian soldiers and young Ukrainian soldiers and other people, in addition, in the towns and cities.\u00a0 And we will consider that a very important thing and a big accomplishment, because it was going nowhere until this administration came in.\u00a0 They hadn\u2019t spoken to President Putin in two years.\u00a0 And so, we\u2019ll keep you advised.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Before we begin the Cabinet, I\u2019d like to have Scott\n\nand a couple of people say a few things.\u00a0 But most importantly \u2014 where are you?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY TURNER:\u00a0 I\u2019m right here, sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is a gentleman who\u2019s going places \u2014 the head of HUD.\u00a0 And he\u2019s going to say \u2014 you all know him.\u00a0 And you\u2019re going to say grace \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY TURNER:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 and then we\u2019ll have our meeting, right?\n\nSECRETARY TURNER:\u00a0 Yes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY TURNER:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Let\u2019s pray.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Father, we thank you for this awesome privilege, Father, to be in your presence.\u00a0 God, thank you that you\u2019ve allowed us to see this day.\u00a0 The Bible says that your mercies are new every morning.\u00a0 And, Father God, we give you the glory and the honor.\u00a0 Thank you, God, for President Trump, Father, for appointing us.\u00a0 Father God, thank you for anointing us to do this job.\u00a0 Father, we pray you\u2019ll give the president and the vice president wisdom, Father God, as they lead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Father, I pray for all of my colleagues that are here around the table and in this room.\u00a0 Lord God, we pray that we would lead with a righteous clarity, Father God, and as we serve the people of this country and every perspective agency, every job that we have, Father, we would humble ourselves before you that we would lead in a manner that you\u2019ve called us to lead and to serve.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Father, the Bible says the blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.\u00a0 But, Father, we today honor you.\u00a0 And in your rightful place, Father, thank you for giving us this opportunity to restore faith in this country and be a blessing to the people of America.\u00a0 And, Lord God, today in our meeting, we pray that you will be glorified in our conversation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Jesus\u2019 name, amen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PARTICIPANTS:\u00a0 Amen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Scott, that was a very good job you did.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done that before, haven\u2019t you?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, Scott Turner is a terrific young guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s heading up HUD, and he\u2019s going to make us all very proud, right?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY TURNER:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In just over one month, illegal border crossings have plummeted by numbers that nobody has actually ever seen before.\u00a0 It\u2019s much more than 100 percent.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019ve unleashed American energy at levels that will soon be reported, but we think we\u2019re going to get it going very quickly.\u00a0 We have incredible people on the energy front.\u00a0\n\nI think we have really great people on every front.\u00a0 I\u2019ll let you know if they\u2019re not good, but I think they really are.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re fighting every day to get the prices down.\u00a0 The inflation is stopping slowly, but part of the reason it\u2019s stopping is because of high interest rates and other problems that we inherited.\u00a0 But we have to get the prices down \u2014 not the inflation down \u2014 the prices of eggs and various other things.\u00a0 Eggs are a disaster.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The secretary of Agriculture is going to be showing you a chart that\u2019s actually mindboggling what\u2019s happened \u2014 how low they were with us and how high they are now.\u00a0 But I think we can do something about it \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY ROLLINS:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 Madam Secretary.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY ROLLINS:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I think you\u2019re going to do a fantastic job in that position.\u00a0\n\nOne of the most important initiatives is DOGE, and we have cut billions and billions and billions of dollars.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking to get it maybe to a trillion dollars.\u00a0 If we can do that, we\u2019re going to start getting to be at a point where we can think in terms of balancing budgets, believe it or not, something you haven\u2019t heard in many, many years \u2014 decades, actually.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a big \u2014 whether it\u2019s this year or next year, I think we\u2019ll be very close to balancing budgets.\u00a0 And the DOGE is very important.\u00a0\n\nAnd Elon is here to give you a summary of what\u2019s happening, some of the things they found \u2014 some of the horrible things they found \u2014 some of the theft and fraud, and we call it waste and abuse, but a lot of fraud, and probably some fraud that we\u2019re not going to be able to prove is fraud, but when you hear the names and the places where this money is going, it\u2019s a disgrace.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we\u2019ve requested that a lot of people \u2014 we want to make sure that the people are working.\u00a0 So, letters were sent out, and I think everyone at this table is very much behind it.\u00a0 And if they aren\u2019t, I\u2019d want them to speak up.\u00a0 But they\u2019re very much behind it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Letters were sent out to people just to find out, if the people exist, do they work?\u00a0 Who do they work for?\u00a0 Where are they?\u00a0 You know, where have they been working?\u00a0 Have they been working for other companies or other entities at all and being paid by the government, so they have two jobs, but they\u2019re supposed to have one?\u00a0\n\nAnd the letter asks some simple questions like, \u201cWhat have you done lately?\u201d\u00a0 And if they can answer that \u2014 because I can.\u00a0 I can tell you everything I\u2019ve done for the last long period of time \u2014 a lot more than a week.\u00a0\n\nAnd in many cases, we haven\u2019t gotten responses.\u00a0 Usually that means that maybe that person doesn\u2019t exist or that person doesn\u2019t want to say they\u2019re working for another company while being paid by the United States government.\u00a0\n\nSo, there\u2019s a lot of interesting things.\u00a0 It\u2019s very unique, but we have a very unique situation because we have a lot of people that were scamming our country.\u00a0 We have a lot of dishonest people.\u00a0 We have a lot of people that took advantage of a lot of different situations, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to ask, if it\u2019s possible, to have Elon get up first and talk about DOGE, because it seems to be of great interest to everyone.\u00a0\n\nI will say that there is a large group of people in this country that have such admiration for what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 I got elected with a tremendous vote \u2014 winning every swing state, winning the popular vote, winning the counties by thousands of counties.\u00a0 I think it was 2,800 to 500.\u00a0 2,800 counties to 500 counties.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0\n\nAnd so, we have a mandate to do this, and this is part of the reason I got elected.\u00a0 I got elected based on taxes and based on many things, the border, but also based on balancing budgets and getting our country back into shape, and this is a big part of it.\u00a0\n\nSo, Elon, if you could get up and explain where you are, how you\u2019re doing, and how much we\u2019re cutting.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to have you.\u00a0 He\u2019s been a tremendously successful guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s really working so hard.\u00a0 And he\u2019s got businesses to run.\u00a0 And in many ways, they say, \u201cHow do you do this?\u201d\u00a0 And, you know, he\u2019s sacrificing a lot and \u2014 getting a lot of praise, I\u2019ll tell you, but he\u2019s also getting hit.\u00a0 And we would expect that, and that\u2019s the way it works.\u00a0\n\nSo, I\u2019d like to have Elon Musk please say a few words.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MR. MUSK:\u00a0 Well, tha- \u2014 thank you \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Elon.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Well, I a- \u2014 I actually just call myself humble tech support here \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 because this is actually \u2014 as crazy as it sounds, that \u2014 that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing is helping fix the government computer systems.\u00a0 Many of these systems are extremely old.\u00a0 They don\u2019t communicate.\u00a0 There are a lot of mistakes in the systems.\u00a0 The software doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0 The \u2014 so, we are actually tech support.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s ironic, but it\u2019s true.\n\nThe \u2014 the overall goal here with the DOGE team is to help address the enormous deficit.\u00a0 We simply cannot sustain, as a country, $2 trillion deficits.\u00a0 The interest rates \u2014 just the interest on the national debt now exceeds the Defense Department spending.\u00a0\n\nWe spend a lot on the Defense Department, but we\u2019re spending, like, over a trillion dollars on interest.\u00a0 If this continues, the country will go \u2014 become de facto bankrupt.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not an optional thing.\u00a0 It is an essential thing.\u00a0 That \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the reason I\u2019m here and taking a lot of flak and getting a lot of death threats, by the way.\u00a0 I can, like, stack them up, you know.\n\nBut if we don\u2019t do this, America will go bankrupt.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it has to be done.\u00a0 And I\u2019m confident, at this point \u2014 knock on wood, you know \u2014 knock on my wooden head \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of wood up there \u2014 that we can actually find a trillion dollars in savings.\u00a0 That would be roughly 15 percent of the $7 trillion budget.\n\nAnd obviously, that can only be done with the support of everyone in this room.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to thank everyone for \u2014 for your support.\u00a0 Thank you very much this.\u00a0 This \u2014 this can only be done with \u2014 with your support.\n\nSo, this is \u2014 it\u2019s really \u2014 DOGE is a support function for the president and for the \u2014 the agencies and departments to help achieve those savings and to effect- \u2014 effectively find 15 percent in reduction in fraud and \u2014 and waste.\n\nAnd \u2014 and we bring the receipts.\u00a0 So, people say, like, \u201cWell, is this real?\u201d\u00a0 Just go to DOGE.gov.\u00a0 We l- \u2014 we \u2014 line item by line item, we specify each item.\u00a0 So \u2014 and w- \u2014 and I \u2014 I should say, we \u2014 also, we will make mistakes.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be perfect.\u00a0 But when we make mistake, we\u2019ll fix it very quickly.\u00a0\n\nSo, for example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled, very briefly, was Ebola \u2014 Ebola prevention.\u00a0 I think we all wanted Ebola prevention.\u00a0 So, we restored the Ebola prevention immediately, and there was no interruption.\n\nBut we do need to move quickly if we\u2019re \u2014 if we\u2019re to achieve a trillion-dollar deficit reduction in tw- \u2014 in \u2014 in financial year 2026.\u00a0 It requires saving $4 billion per day, every day from now through the end of September.\u00a0 But we can do it, and we will do it.\n\nThank you.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, do you have any questions of Elon while we\u2019re on the subject of DOGE?\u00a0 Because we\u2019ll finish off with that.\u00a0 And if you would have any questions, please ask \u2014 you could ask me or Elon.\n\nGo ahead, please.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Musk.\u00a0 I just wanted to ask you, the \u2014 President Trump put out a Truth Social today saying that everybody in the Cabinet was \u2014 was happy with you.\u00a0 I just wondered if that \u2014 if you had heard otherwise, and if you had heard anything about members of the Cabinet who weren\u2019t happy with the way things were going.\u00a0 And if so, what are you doing to address those \u2014 any dissatisfaction?\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 To the best of \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hey, Elon, let the Cabinet speak just for a second.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is anybody unhappy with Elon?\u00a0 If you are, we\u2019ll throw them out of here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Is anybody unhappy?\u00a0 (Applause.)\n\nThey are \u2014 they have a lot of respect for Elon and that he\u2019s doing this.\u00a0 And some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you, for the most part, I think everyone is not only happy, they\u2019re thrilled.\u00a0\n\nSo, go ahead, Elon.\n\nSECRETARY ROLLINS:\u00a0 And grateful.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 And President Trump has put together, I think, the best cabinet ever, literally.\u00a0 So, I \u2014 and I do not give false praise.\u00a0 This \u2014 this is an incredible group of people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think such a talented team has actually ever been assembled.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s literally the best cabinet that the country has ever had.\u00a0 And I think the companies should be incredibly appreciative of the people in this room.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you.\u00a0 Mr. Musk.\u00a0 Are there \u2014 about half of the government employees so far appear to have responded to your request for what they\u2019ve been doing over the past week.\u00a0 Is there a timeline in place for next moves for people being fired?\u00a0 And when can the American people expect to see results from that?\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Well, to be \u2014 to be clear, like, the \u2014 I think that email, perhaps, was misinterpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review.\u00a0 \u201cDo you have a pulse?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cDo you have a pulse and two neurons?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.\n\nThis is, you know, I think, not a high bar, is what I\u2019m saying.\u00a0 This is a \u2014 should be \u2014 anyone could accomplish this.\u00a0\n\nBut what we are trying to get to the bottom of is we think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can\u2019t respond, and \u2014 and some people who are not real people, like they\u2019re literally fictional individuals that are collecting payche- \u2014 well, somebody is collecting paychecks on a fictional individual.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re just literally trying to figure out are these people real, are they alive, and can they write an email, which I think is a reasonable expectation for the Amer- \u2014 you know, the American public would have at least that expectation of someone in the public sector.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Musk \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Musk \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 roughly a million employees \u2014\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 This is not a \u2014 this is not a high bar, guys.\u00a0 Come on.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roughly a million employees have responded so far to this email.\u00a0 Does that mean that the remaining 1 million or so federal employees now risk being terminated?\u00a0 And is it your understanding and expectation when you post a directive on X that the Cabinet secretaries will follow that order?\u00a0 Because several agencies have instructed employees that this is voluntary or not to respond.\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, I mean, to be cl \u2014 so, I guess there was a \u2014 like, last week, the president en- \u2014 encouraged me, via Truth Social and also via phone call, to be more aggressive.\u00a0 And I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0 You know, \u201cYes, sir, Mr. President.\u00a0 We will indeed do that.\u201d\u00a0 The president is the commander in chief.\u00a0 I \u2014 I do what the president asks.\n\nSo \u2014 and I said, \u201cCan we send out an email to everyone, just saying, \u2018What did you get done last week?\u2019\u201d\u00a0 The president said yes.\u00a0 So, I \u2014 I did that.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, we \u2014 we got a partial response.\u00a0 But we \u2014 we\u2019re going to send another email.\u00a0 But we \u2014 our \u2014 our goal is not to be capricious or \u2014 or unfair.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 we want to give people every opportunity to send an email and the email could simply be \u201cWhat I\u2019m working on is too sensitive or classified to \u2014 to describe.\u201d\u00a0 Like, literally, just re- \u2014 that would be sufficient.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 you know, I think this is just common sense.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what is your target number for \u2014 for how many workers, employees you\u2019re looking to cut total?\n\nMR. MUSK:\u00a0 We \u2014 we wish to keep everyone who is doing a job that is essential and doing that job well.\u00a0 But if \u2014 if they\u2019re \u2014 if the job is not essential or they\u2019re not doing the job well, they obviously should not be on the public payroll.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I have to \u2014 I would like to add \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nWait a minute.\u00a0 Wait.\u00a0 Wait.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to add that those million people that haven\u2019t responded, though, Elon, they are on the bubble.\u00a0 You know, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re thrilled about it.\u00a0 You know, they haven\u2019t responded.\u00a0 Now, maybe they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Maybe we\u2019re paying people that don\u2019t exist.\n\nDon\u2019t forget, we just got here.\u00a0 This group just got here.\u00a0 But those people are on the bubble, as they say.\u00a0 You know, maybe they\u2019re going to be gone.\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019re not around.\u00a0 Maybe they have other jobs.\u00a0 Maybe they moved and they\u2019re not where they\u2019re supposed to be.\u00a0 A lot of things could have happened.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that Biden ran a very tight administration.\u00a0 They spent money like nobody has ever spent money before, wasted money \u2014 the Green New Scam, all of the different things they spent money on.\u00a0\n\nAnd you\u2019ve seen that.\u00a0 You\u2019ve seen that with some of the things that I read in speeches.\u00a0 I read them, and people can\u2019t believe, when I read them, $20 million here, $30 million here for, you know, a little educational course on something.\u00a0 Circumcision, right?\u00a0 Circumcision.\u00a0 $20 million to inform the people of such-and-such a country on other things and other things other than that.\n\nSo, yeah, those people are \u2014 right now, we\u2019re trying to find out who those people are that haven\u2019t responded.\u00a0 Now, there\u2019ll be some agencies \u2014 like Marco has people within State that are right now doing very classified, very confidential work.\u00a0 And we understand that, and we\u2019ve talked.\u00a0 And, you know, we\u2019re being a little more surgical.\u00a0\n\nAnd Marco is doing a lot of things himself.\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 and some of the secretaries are.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be going to them.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be talking about it today.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to ask them to do their own DOGE.\u00a0 In other words, they\u2019ll look in their group and who \u2014\n\nI spoke with Lee Zeldin, and he thinks he\u2019s going to be cutting 65 or so percent of the people from Environmental, and we\u2019re going to speed up the process, too, at the same time.\u00a0 He had a lot of people that weren\u2019t doing their job \u2014 they were just obstructionists \u2014 and a lot of people that didn\u2019t exist, I guess, Lee, too.\u00a0 You found a lot of empty spots that the people weren\u2019t there.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd I think Education is going to be one of those.\u00a0 You go around Washington, you see all these buildings \u2014 the Department of Education.\u00a0 We want to move education back to the states, where it belongs.\u00a0 Iowa should have education.\u00a0 Indiana should run their own education.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to see education go way up.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re ranked at the very bottom of the list, but we\u2019re at the top of the list in one thing: the cost per pupil.\u00a0 We spend more money per pupil than any other country in the world, and yet it\u2019s Denmark and Norway, Sweden.\u00a0 And I \u2014 you hate to say this \u2014 and, you know, we\u2019re going to get along very well with China, but it\u2019s a competitor: They\u2019re at the top of the list.\u00a0 They\u2019re among the top 10, usually.\u00a0 And they\u2019re a very big country, so we can\u2019t use that as an excuse \u2014 right? \u2014 because we\u2019re a very big country too.\n\nBut we\u2019re \u2013 we were ranked last time \u2014 under Biden, we were ranked 40 out of 40.\u00a0 They do the 40 certain nations that they\u2019ve done for a long time.\u00a0 It seems to be 40, for whatever reason.\u00a0 And we were ranked number 40.\u00a0 A year ago, we were 38.\u00a0 Then we were 39.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2014 we hit 40.\u00a0 And so, we\u2019re last in that, and we\u2019re first in cost per pupil.\u00a0 So, I would say that\u2019s unacceptable.\n\nLawrence, do you have something?\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, Mr. President, I know you like competition, and I know it\u2019s early.\u00a0 So, which department are you most impressed with?\u00a0\n\nAnd then, to Mr. Mu- \u2014 (laughter).\u00a0 That\u2019s the first one.\u00a0 And, Mr. Musk, which department have you received the most resistance from?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you first.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think both of those questions are a little bit \u2014 well, you\u2019re a pretty controversial guy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Look, it\u2019s very early.\u00a0 Right now, I think I\u2019m impressed with everybody.\u00a0 So far, everybody.\u00a0 If I wasn\u2019t, in the first month, we\u2019d \u2014 and some of them just got here.\u00a0 They just got approved two days ago, right?\n\nBut I think I\u2019m very impressed with everybody.\u00a0 So far, I\u2019m very happy with all of the choices.\n\nI think that Elon has done incredibly with some groups.\u00a0 And some groups are much easier than others.\u00a0 It is true: State is a, you know, very difficult situation.\u00a0 We\u2019re right now negotiating very successfully, I think, with Russia and with Ukraine, and we have a lot of countries involved.\u00a0 And we have to be a little bit careful what we do and who we\u2019re terminating.\u00a0 But Marco is doing that very \u2014 I think he\u2019s going to be very precise.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be \u2014\n\nWe\u2019re cutting down government.\u00a0 We\u2019re cutting down the size of government.\u00a0 We have to.\u00a0 We\u2019re bloated.\u00a0 We\u2019re sloppy.\u00a0 We have a lot of people that aren\u2019t doing their job.\u00a0 We have a lot of people that don\u2019t exist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You look at Social Security as an example.\u00a0 I mean, you have so many people in Social Security where, if you believe it, they\u2019re 200 years old.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re doing is finding out: Are checks going out for that and is somebody cashing those checks who\u2019s maybe 35 years old?\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, there\u2019s a lot of dishonesty.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of fraud.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But I think at this moment, I\u2019ll take Elon off the spot.\u00a0 I think that he\u2019s impressed \u2014 he said it very well \u2013better than I can say it \u2014 that he\u2019s impressed with the people in this room.\u00a0 Very impressed.\u00a0 And I am too.\u00a0 And it\u2019s too early to say, but I think everybody is on board.\u00a0 They all know \u2014 we want to balance a budget.\u00a0 We want to have a balanced budget within a reasonably short period of time, meaning maybe by next year or the year after, but maybe \u2014 maybe even sooner than that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, your \u2014 your number one issue was the border.\u00a0 We just got new information that they\u2019re doxing our federal agents.\u00a0 They\u2019re putting their personal information out there, these activists, and they\u2019re disrupting the operations.\u00a0 So, you got Tren de Aragua running all across the country \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we have activists.\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0 And a lot of those \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, what are we going to do about the activists \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 A lot of those activists are acting illegally.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll give that to our attorney general, and she\u2019ll take a look at that very strongly.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also having tremendous support from Border Patrol, from ICE.\u00a0 The ICE agents have been unbelievable.\u00a0 Border Patrol \u2014 their leadership at Border Patrol has been incredible, and they\u2019re working very well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, as you know \u2014 and I saw you reporting it this morning, actually \u2014 we set records on the least number of illegal aliens coming in, migrants coming into our country that we\u2019ve had in more than 50 years.\u00a0 And we did this all within a period of weeks, because we took over a mess.\u00a0 The world was pouring in.\u00a0 And remember, they were coming in from jails and prisons and mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were gang members and drug dealers.\u00a0 Anybody who wanted to come in, they came.\u00a0 And from not just South America, from all over the world.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s amazing what they\u2019ve done.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Kristi and \u2014 and Tom Homan, the job they\u2019ve done has been absolutely amazing.\u00a0 We set records for \u2014 and we want people to come into our country, by the way, but they want to come in \u2014 they have to come in legally.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I want that to be really understood.\u00a0 We want people in our country, but they have to come in legally.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I follow on that, Mr. President?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About the \u2014 the Trump gold card idea \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that you unveiled yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I hope you liked it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I await more information.\u00a0 But the question is: Does this reflect a view, on your part, that the American immigration system has never been properly monetized as you feel it should be?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, not so much monetized.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t been properly run.\u00a0 I get calls from, as an example, companies where they want to hire the number one student at a school.\u00a0 A person comes from India, China, Japan, lots of different places, and they go to Harvard, the Wharton School of Finance.\u00a0 They go to Yale.\u00a0 They go to all great schools.\u00a0 And they graduate number one in their class, and they are made job offers, but the offer is immediately rescinded because you have no idea whether or not that person can stay in the country.\u00a0 I want to be able to have that person stay in the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These companies can go and buy a gold card, and they can use it as a matter of recruitment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the same time, the company is using that money to pay down debt.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to pay down a lot of debt with that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are they going to have to \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I think the gold card is going to be used by \u2014 not only for that.\u00a0 I mean, they\u2019ll be used by companies.\u00a0 I mean, I could see Apple \u2014 I\u2019ve spoken with Tim Cook \u2014 and, by the way, he\u2019s going to make a $500 billion investment in the country only because of the results of the election and, I think, because of tariffs.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to want to be in the country because of tariffs.\u00a0 Because if you\u2019re in the country, there is no tariff.\u00a0 If you\u2019re out of the country, you got to pay tariffs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s going to be a great investment, I think, that he\u2019s making.\u00a0 I know it\u2019s going to be a great investment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people.\u00a0 And I will tell you, the people that can pay $5 million, they\u2019re going to create jobs.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to spend a lot of money on jobs.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to have to pay taxes on that too.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re going to be hiring people, they\u2019re going to be bringing people in and companies in.\u00a0 And, I don\u2019t know, maybe it will sell like crazy.\u00a0 I happen to think it\u2019s going to sell like crazy.\u00a0 It\u2019s a bargain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we\u2019ll \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will they have to commit to a certain number?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 know fairly soon.\u00a0 I think Howard and \u2014 and Scott \u2014 a few of you, really, are responsible for it.\u00a0 But, Howard, if you want to discuss that for a couple of minutes, I think I\u2019d like to have you.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be a very successful program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is Commerce.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 So, the EB-5 program, which has been around for many years, had investment of a million dollars into projects in America.\u00a0 And those projects were often suspect, they didn\u2019t really work out, there wasn\u2019t any oversight of it.\u00a0 And so, for a million-dollar investment, you got a visa, and then you came into the country and ended up with a green card.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, it was poorly overseen, poorly executed.\u00a0 Then you had our border open, where millions of people came through.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, the idea is we will have a proper business.\u00a0 We will modify the EB-5 agreement.\u00a0 Kristi and I are working on it together.\u00a0 For $5 million, they\u2019ll get a license from the Department of Commerce.\u00a0 Then they\u2019ll make a proper investment on the EB-5, right?\u00a0 And we think Scott and I will design the EB-5 investment model, because Scott and I are the best people together to do that.\u00a0 So, this is joint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is exactly the Trump administration.\u00a0 We all work together.\u00a0 We work it out to be the best.\u00a0 And if we sell \u2014 just remember \u2014 200,000 \u2014 there\u2019s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now \u2014 200,000 of these gold green cards is $1 trillion\n\nto pay down our debt, and that\u2019s why the president is doing it, because we are going to balance this budget, and we are going to pay off the debt under President Trump.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And to qualify, do you have to promise and make commitments to create a certain number of jobs here in the U.S.?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Because not all these people are going to be job builders.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be successful people, or they\u2019ll be people that were hired from colleges, like \u2014 sort of like paying an athlete a bonus.\u00a0 I mean, Apple or one of the companies will go out and they\u2019ll spend five mil- \u2014 they\u2019ll buy five of them, and they\u2019re going to get five people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Look, I\u2019ve had the complaint where \u2014 I\u2019ve had the complaint from a lot of companies where they go out to hire people, and they can\u2019t hire them b- \u2014 out of colleges.\u00a0 And you know what they do?\u00a0 They go back to India, or they go back to the country where they came, and they open up a company, and they become billionaires.\u00a0 They become \u2014 and they\u2019re employing thousands and there are a lot of examples.\u00a0\n\nThere are some really big examples where they were forced out of the country.\u00a0 They graduated top in their class at a great school, and they weren\u2019t able to stay.\u00a0 This is all the time you hear it.\u00a0\n\nAnd the biggest complaint I get from companies, other than overregulation, which we took care of, but we\u2019re going to have to take care of it here, because a lot of that was put back on by Biden.\u00a0 But the biggest complaint is the fact that they can\u2019t have any longevity with people.\u00a0 This way, they have pretty much unlimited longevity.\u00a0\n\nAlso, with the $5 million, you know, that\u2019s a path to citizenship.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s going to be \u2014 it\u2019s sort of a green card-plus, and it\u2019s a path to citizenship.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to call it the gold card.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s going to be very treasured.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to do very well.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to start selling, hopefully, in about two weeks.\n\nNow, just so you understand, if we sell a million \u2014 right? \u2014 a million, that\u2019s $5 trillion.\u00a0 Five trillion.\u00a0 Howard was using a different number, but that\u2019s $5 trillion. \u00a0If we sell 10 million, which is possible \u2014 10 million highly productive people coming in or people that we\u2019re going to make productive \u2014 they\u2019ll be young, but they\u2019re talented, like a talented athlete \u2014 that\u2019s $50 trillion.\u00a0\n\nThat means our debt is totally paid off, and we have $15 trillion above that.\u00a0 And \u2014 now, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to sell that many.\u00a0 Maybe we won\u2019t so many at all.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019re going to sell a lot, because I think there\u2019s \u2014 there really is a thirst.\u00a0\n\nNo other country can do this, because people don\u2019t want to go to other countries.\u00a0 They want to come here.\u00a0 Everybody wants to come here, especially since November 5th.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 They\u2019ll all be vetted, by the way.\u00a0 All these people will be vetted.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How?\n\nSECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 They\u2019ll be vetted.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Ukraine.\u00a0 Can you talk a lot \u2014 a little bit about what type of security guarantees you\u2019re willing to make?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have Europe do that, because it\u2019s in \u2014 you know, we\u2019re talking about Europe is their next-door neighbor.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to make sure everything goes well.\u00a0\n\nAnd as you know, we\u2019ll be making a \u2014 we\u2019ll be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth.\u00a0 We very much need rare earth.\u00a0 They have great rare earth.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be working with Secretary Burgum and with Chris.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be working on that together.\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to be able to have tremendous \u2014 I mean, this gives us \u2014 because we don\u2019t have that much of it here.\u00a0 We have some, but we don\u2019t have that much, and we need a lot more to really propel us to the next level of \u2014 to lead in every way.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading right now with AI.\u00a0 We\u2019re leading with everything right now, but we have to \u2014 we need resources.\u00a0\n\nWe have to double our electric capacity.\u00a0 We have to do many things.\u00a0 We have to really triple, if you think of it, the electric capacity from what we have right now, if you can believe it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But will the United States \u2014 can I \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, I just say this.\u00a0 So, the deal we\u2019re making gets us \u2014 it brings us great wealth.\u00a0 We get back the money that we spent, and we hope that we\u2019re going to be able to settle this up.\u00a0\n\nWe want to settle it.\u00a0 We want to stop \u2014 I tell you what.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing it for two reasons, but the number one reason, by far, is to watch \u2014 all these people being killed.\u00a0 I see pictures every week from \u2014 I assume satellite pictures, mostly, but there\u2019s some pictures on site of thousands of soldiers that are being killed.\u00a0 They\u2019re being decimated, because equipment today \u2014 military equipment is so powerful and so devastating.\u00a0 And, number one, I want to see people stop.\u00a0\n\nAnd they\u2019re not from here.\u00a0 They\u2019re from primarily two other countries.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, by the way, let\u2019s talk about the Middle East.\u00a0 We got to solve that problem too.\u00a0 And that\u2019s come a long way.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very well in that also.\u00a0 A lot of things are happening on that.\u00a0 But I\u2019m watching soldiers being killed \u2014 Ukrainian and Russian soldiers being killed.\u00a0 My number one thing is to get that stopped.\u00a0\n\nMy number two thing is I don\u2019t want to have to pay any more money, because we\u2019ve \u2014 Biden has spent $350 billion without any chance of getting it back.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re going to be getting all of that money back, plus a lot more.\u00a0 And we provided a great thing. \u00a0I mean, we\u2019ve provided something very important, and we\u2019ll be working with Ukraine and \u2014 because we\u2019ll be taking that \u2014 we\u2019re going to be taking what we\u2019re entitled to take.\u00a0\n\nNow, they spent $350 billion, and Europe spent $100 billion.\u00a0 Now, does anybody really think that\u2019s fair?\u00a0 But then we find out, a little while ago \u2014 not so long ago, a few months ago, I found out that the money they spent, they get back, but the money we spent, we don\u2019t get back.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to get it back.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd we\u2019ll be able to make a deal.\u00a0 And again, President Zelenskyy is coming to sign the deal.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great deal for Ukraine, too, because they get us over there, and we\u2019re going to be working over there.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be on the land.\u00a0 And, you know, in that way, it\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s sort of automatic security, because nobody\u2019s going to be messing around with our people when we\u2019re there.\u00a0 And so, we\u2019ll be there in that way.\u00a0\n\nBut Europe will be watching it very closely.\u00a0 I know that UK has said and France has said that they want to put \u2014 they volunteered to put so-called peacekeepers on the site.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you had mentioned the high cost of eggs, and we\u2019ve seen consumer confidence this week have a sharp drop from last month \u2014 the biggest dip in, I believe, three years.\u00a0 Why is that \u2014 your assessment, why is that the case and is there anything you can do?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think that consumer confidence \u2014 if you look at confidence in the nation, it had the biggest increase in the history of the chart.\u00a0 It went up 42 points in a period of, like, days after the election, since the election.\u00a0 So, since the election, the confidence in our nation \u2014 including right track, wrong track \u2014 the first time it\u2019s ever happened, where we were on the right track, because this country has been on the wrong track for a long time.\u00a0\n\nSo, the confidence in business, confidence in the country has reached an all-time high.\u00a0 We have never reached levels like we are right now.\n\nOkay.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you said \u2014 Mr. President, you\u2019ve been very clear in saying that as long as you\u2019re president, Iran will never get a nuclear weapon.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it also your policy that as long as you\u2019re president, China will never take Taiwan by force?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I never comment on that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t comment on any \u2014 because I don\u2019t want to ever put myself in that position.\u00a0 And if I said it, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be saying it to you.\u00a0 I\u2019d be saying it to other people, maybe people around this table \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and very specific people around this table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it a concern (inaudible)?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, I don\u2019t want to put myself in that position.\u00a0 But I can tell you what, I have a great relationship with President Xi.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a great relationship with him.\u00a0 We want them to come in and invest.\u00a0\n\nI see so many things saying that we don\u2019t want China in this country.\u00a0 That\u2019s not right.\u00a0 We want them to invest in the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s good.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of money coming in.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll invest in China.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do things with China.\u00a0\n\nThe relationship we\u2019ll have with China would be a very good one.\u00a0 I see all of these phony reports that we don\u2019t want their money; we don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\u00a0 That\u2019s wrong.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re going to have a good relationship with China, but they won\u2019t be able to take advantage of us.\u00a0 What they did to Biden was \u2014 he didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u00a0 The administration didn\u2019t know what they were doing.\u00a0 It was very sad to watch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to have a good relationship with China and Russia and Ukraine and the Middle East.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing things that \u2014\n\nLook, when I left, we had no wars.\u00a0 We had defeated ISIS totally.\u00a0 We had no inflation.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have the Afghanistan withdrawal \u2014 the worst withdrawal anybody has ever seen.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that President Putin looked at that.\u00a0 He said, \u201cWow, these guys are a paper tiger.\u00a0 Look at\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re no paper tiger.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t forget: We got rid of ISIS in three weeks.\u00a0 People said it would take five years.\u00a0 We did it, because when I came in, I let them do what they had to do.\u00a0 And the man that headed that operation is now going to be your \u2014 your chairman, right?\n\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\u00a0\n\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And \u2014 \u201cRazin\u201d Caine.\u00a0 I liked him right from the beginning.\u00a0 As soon as I heard his name, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s my guy.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOkay.\u00a0 Any other questions?\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, has there been enough de- \u2014 decreases in crossings at the border for you to continue the pause on tariffs against Mexico and Canada?\u00a0 And, if not \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to \u2014 I\u2019m not stopping the tariffs, no.\u00a0 Millions of people have died because of the fentanyl that comes over the border.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even with the 90 percent drop in border crossings, though, this \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s \u2014 well \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 last month compared to about a year ago?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, they\u2019ve been good, but that\u2019s also due to us.\u00a0 Mostly due to us.\u00a0 I mean \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on CBS \u2014\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 it\u2019s very hard.\u00a0 It\u2019s, right now, very hard to come through the border.\u00a0 But the \u2014 look, the damage has been done.\u00a0 We\u2019ve lost millions of people due to fentanyl.\u00a0 It comes mostly from China, but it comes through Mexico, and it comes through Canada.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Presi- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I have to tell you that, you know, on April 2nd \u2014 I was going to do it on April 1st, but I\u2019m a little bit superstitious, so I made it April 2nd \u2014 the tariffs go on, not all of them but a lot of them.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019re going to see something that\u2019s going to be amazing.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve been taken advantage of as a country for a long period of time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been \u2014 we\u2019ve been tariffed, but we didn\u2019t tariff.\u00a0 Now, I did.\u00a0 When I was here, I tariffed.\u00a0 We took in $700 billion from China \u2014 $700 billion.\u00a0 Not one president in this \u2014 in the history of our country took in 10 cents from China.\u00a0 At the same time, China respected us.\u00a0\n\nNow, when COVID came in, that was a different deal.\u00a0 I used to call it the China virus.\u00a0 I guess I can call it the China virus again, but, you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s an accurate term, but I won\u2019t do that out of respect to China.\u00a0 Okay?\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nSay it again.\u00a0 What?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Gaza.\u00a0 I just wondered if there\u2019s any progress towards the second phase of the ceasefire that you can tell us about.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m very disappointed when I see four \u2014 four bodies came in today.\u00a0 These are young people.\u00a0 Young people don\u2019t die.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Young people don\u2019t die.\u00a0 These are young people.\u00a0 Four bodies came in today.\u00a0 They think they\u2019re doing us a favor by sending us bodies.\u00a0\n\nSo, look, that\u2019s a decision that has to be made by Israel, by Bibi, but Israel has to make that decision.\u00a0 We got a lot of hostages back, but it\u2019s very sad what happened to those people.\u00a0 I mean, you had a young lady with her hand practically blown off.\u00a0 You know why it blew up?\u00a0 Because she put up her hand to try and stop a bullet that was coming her way, and it hit her hand and blew off her fingers, big part of her hand.\u00a0\n\nThis is a vicious group of people, and Israel is going to have to decide what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Phase one is going to be ending.\u00a0 Think of it: Today, they sent in four bodies.\u00a0 Bodies.\u00a0\n\nAnd I will say one thing, though.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spoken to a lot of the parents and a lot of the people involved.\u00a0 They want those bodies almost as much and maybe even just as much as they wanted their son or their daughter.\u00a0 Amazing.\u00a0 \u201cPlease, sir.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 My son is dead, but they have his body.\u00a0 Please can you get it for us?\u201d\u00a0 They \u2014 it\u2019s the biggest thing.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible the level \u2014 they want the bodies of these people.\u00a0 They\u2019re dead.\u00a0 They\u2019re dead.\u00a0\n\nAnd, you know, when I saw the ones that came in two weeks ago, they looked like they just got out of a concentration camp.\u00a0 Then, the following week, a group came in, and they weren\u2019t as bad \u2014 in as bad of shape.\n\nBut Israel is going to have to make a decision.\u00a0 You\u2019re right, phase one, and now phase two has started.\u00a0 And today, we got some, you know, very, very sad \u2014 we knew they were dead, by the way.\u00a0 We knew they were going to be bodies, as opposed to people that were living.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a very sad situation.\u00a0\n\nAt some point, somebody is going to say we got to do something about this.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you were just talking about Afghanistan and the botched withdrawal.\u00a0 Have all the generals or command staff that were involved with the withdrawal been fired or relieved of duty?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s a great idea.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 sorry, I\u2019m not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that.\u00a0 If I had his place, I\u2019d fire every single one of them, Pete.\u00a0 Pete, that\u2019s a very good question.\u00a0\n\nSECRETARY HEGSETH:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s a question we\u2019ve thought a lot about.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a complete review of every single aspect of what happened with the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan and plan to have full accountability.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the first things we announced at the Defense Department for that reason, sir.\u00a0\n\nCertainly General \u201cRazin\u201d Caine, who\u2019s on his way in, was not a part of that.\u00a0 Instead, was a part of leading the effort against ISIS by untying the hands of war fighters and finishing the job properly and then bringing our troops home.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re taking a very different view, obviously, than the previous administration, and there will be full accountability.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t see big promotions in that group.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I think they\u2019re going to be largely gone.\u00a0 I know the man on my left.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re going to be largely gone.\u00a0\n\nThat was a horrible display.\u00a0 And, you know, I\u2019ve dealt with the parents and the family of the 13 that were killed.\u00a0 But, you know, nobody ever talks about the 40 that were so badly hurt, with the arms and the legs and the face and the whole thing \u2014 the missing arms and legs.\u00a0 It was so terrible, the way that was handled.\n\nAnd it should have been gone through Bagram.\u00a0 We have a big base with big fences that nobody can get in, and you have, you know, hundreds of acres, instead of a little local airport where the whole place went crazy.\u00a0 That was so badly handled.\u00a0 And I would think that most of those people are going to be gone.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are we going to take Bagram back?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u00a0So, I\u2019ll tell you what has bothered me very much \u2014 very, very much: We give billions of dollars to Afghanistan.\u00a0 Nobody knows that.\u00a0 Nobody knew that.\u00a0 Do you know we give billions of dollars to Afghanistan?\u00a0 And yet we left behind all of that equipment, which wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0\n\nYou know, we were getting out under me.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one that got it down to 5,000 people.\u00a0 We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it\u2019s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.\u00a0\n\nSo, we were going to keep Bagram.\u00a0 We were going to keep a small force on Bagram.\u00a0 We were going to have Bagram Air Base, one of the biggest air bases in the world.\u00a0 One of the biggest runways, one of the most powerful runways, in the sense that it was very heavy concrete and steel.\u00a0 You could carry about anything.\u00a0 You could land anything on those runways.\u00a0\n\nWe gave it up.\u00a0 And you know who\u2019s occupying it right now?\u00a0 China.\u00a0 China. \u00a0Biden gave it up.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to keep that, and we\u2019re going to have a withdrawal, and we\u2019re going to take our equipment.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do it properly.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do it very \u2014 we\u2019re going to keep the equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, they ran out.\u00a0 It was \u2014 what happened there was a \u2014 in fact, you know, in all fairness to Putin, when he saw that, he said, \u201cWell, this is our time to go and go into Ukraine,\u201d I guess, because it was \u2014 the timing seemed to be about right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we send them billions of dollars in aid, which nobody knows.\u00a0 If they \u2014 if the American public knew that \u2014 they know it now.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re doing that, I think they should give our equipment back.\u00a0 And I told Pete to study that.\u00a0\n\nBut we left billions \u2014 tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment behind.\u00a0 Brand-new trucks.\u00a0 You see them display it every year on their little roadway someplace where they have a road and they drive the \u2014 you know, waving the flag and talking about America.\u00a0 Beautiful equipment that\u2019s all \u2014 I mean, the top-of-the-line stuff, brand-new stuff.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s getting older.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to pay them.\u00a0 I think we should get a lot of that equipment back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know that Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world.\u00a0 You know why?\u00a0 They\u2019re selling the equipment that we left.\u00a0 We\u2019re first.\u00a0 They were second or third.\u00a0 Can you believe it?\u00a0 They\u2019re selling 777,000\n\nrifles, 70,000 armor-plated \u2014 many of them were armor-plated trucks and vehicles \u2014 70,000.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you think of a used car lot, the biggest one in the country, you have \u2014 I would say, JD, if somebody had 500 cars, that would be a lot.\u00a0\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, that would be quite a lot.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is 70,000 vehicles we had there, and we left it for them.\u00a0 I think we should get it back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the spending bill that passed last night aims to cut $2 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you guarantee that Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security will not be touched?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I mean, I have said it so many times, you shouldn\u2019t be asking me that question.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 This will not be \u201cread my lips.\u201d\u00a0 It won\u2019t be \u201cread my lips\u201d anymore: We\u2019re not going to touch it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now, we are going to look for fraud.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re okay with that, like people that shouldn\u2019t be on, people that are illegal aliens and others \u2014 criminals, in many cases.\u00a0 And that\u2019s with Social Security.\u00a0 We have a lot of people \u2014 you see that immediately.\u00a0 When you see people that are 200 years old that are being sent checks for Social Security \u2014 some of them are actually being sent checks.\u00a0\n\nSo, we\u2019re tracing that down, and I have a feeling that Pam is going to do a very good job with that.\u00a0 But you have a lot of fraud.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, no, I\u2019m not \u2014 we\u2019re not doing anything on that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, part of your mission, sir \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, on CBS News.\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019re in litigation \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part of your mission has been \u2014 thank you.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part of your mission has been to restore executive control over the executive branch.\u00a0 Is it your view of your authority that you have the power to call up any one of or all of the people seated at this table and issue orders that they\u2019re bound to follow?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, yeah.\u00a0 They\u2019ll follow the orders.\u00a0 Yes, they will.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No exceptions?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No except- \u2014 well, let\u2019s see.\u00a0 Let me think.\u00a0 Oh, yeah.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 She\u2019ll have an exception.\u00a0 (The president points at Secretary Rollins.)\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, no exceptions.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, can you clarify the Canada/Mexico tariffs.\u00a0 You had put that 30-day pause.\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You just referred to \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s 25 percent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Twenty-five percent.\u00a0 When does it go into effect?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 April 2nd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 April 2nd for Canada and Mexico?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Correct.\u00a0 And for \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And for the reciprocal?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 and for everything.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 Well, we have the \u2014 the \u2014 fentanyl-related is a pause.\u00a0 If they can prove to the president they\u2019ve done an excellent job, that\u2019s what they first do in 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you guys seen any changes?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 But then the overall is April 2nd.\u00a0 So, the big transaction is April 2nd, but the fentanyl-related things, if they\u2019re working hard on the border, at the end of that 30 days, they have to prove to the president that they\u2019ve satisfied him to that regard.\u00a0 If they have \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be hard to satisfy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 \u2014 then we\u2019ll give them a pause or he won\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be hard to satisfy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 But that\u2019s up to him to see.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We lose 300,000 people a year to fentanyl.\u00a0 Not 100-, not 95-, not 60-, like you read.\u00a0 You know, you\u2019ve been reading it for years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We lost, in my opinion, over the last couple of years, on average, maybe close to 300,000 people dead, and the families are ruined.\u00a0 You know, when they lose a daughter, when they lose a son, the families are never the same.\u00a0 You\u2019re never going to be the same.\u00a0 So, you\u2019re talking about a million people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But when the daughters die, I see it \u2014 daughters die and the sons die because of fentanyl.\u00a0 And in some cases, they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re taking it.\u00a0 They \u2014 they\u2019re buying something else, and it\u2019s laced with fentanyl, and they end up dying.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve known many people who have lost children to fentanyl and for other reasons, but to fentanyl.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a big killer.\u00a0 And those people are never the same people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve seen people that \u2014 for the rest of their lives, they\u2019re not the same people.\u00a0 They\u2019re so different, it\u2019s not even believable.\u00a0 Dynamic people, happy people that are \u2014 they die a miserable death.\u00a0 And that\u2019s because of the crap that comes in through China and through Mexico and through Canada.\u00a0 A lot of it comes through Canada.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The \u2014 Canada \u2014 look, we support Canada $200 billion a year in subsidies one way or the other.\u00a0 We let them make millions of cars.\u00a0 We let them send us lumber.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their lumber.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to free up our lumber.\u00a0 Lee is going to do \u2014 the head of environmental.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to free up our lumber.\u00a0 We have the best lumber there is.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need their lumber.\u00a0 What do we need their lumber for?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you look at the \u2014 we subsidize them $200 billion a year.\u00a0 Without us, Canada can\u2019t make it.\u00a0 You know, Canada relies on us 95 percent.\u00a0 We rely on them 4 percent.\u00a0 Big difference.\u00a0 And I say Canada should be our 51st state.\u00a0 There\u2019s no tariffs, no nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And \u2014 and I say that, we give them military protection.\u00a0 They have a very small military.\u00a0 They spend very little money on military.\u00a0 Or NATO, they\u2019re just about last in terms of payment, because they say, \u201cWhy should we spend on military?\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s a tremendous cost.\u00a0 Most nations can\u2019t afford to even think about it.\u00a0 \u201cWhy should we spend on military?\u00a0 The United States protects us.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I would say that\u2019s largely true.\u00a0 We protect Canada.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not fair.\u00a0 It\u2019s not fair that they\u2019re not paying their way.\u00a0 And if they had to pay their way, they couldn\u2019t exist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I spoke to \u2014 let\u2019s call it the prime minister, rather than the governor.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But when I spoke to him, I said, \u201cWhy are we giving you $200 billion a year?\u201d\u00a0 He was unable to answer the question.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhy are we letting you make millions of cars and send them in?\u201d\u00a0 He was unable to answer the question \u2014 Justin Trudeau, a nice guy.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s a very good guy.\u00a0 I call him Governor Trudeau.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He should be governor, because the fact is that if we don\u2019t give them cars \u2014 we don\u2019t have to give them cars.\u00a0 The c- \u2014 tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States.\u00a0 The tariffs will make it impossible to \u2014 for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States.\u00a0\n\nAnd all I\u2019m asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 million.\u00a0 And we love Canada.\u00a0 I love Canada.\u00a0 I love the people of Canada.\u00a0 And \u2014 but, honestly, it\u2019s not fair for us to be supporting Canada.\u00a0 And if we don\u2019t support them, they don\u2019t subsist as a \u2014 as a nation.\u00a0\n\nOkay.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, when you were talking to Elon \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on the EU tariffs.\u00a0 Mr. President, have you made a decision on what level you will seek on tariffs on the European Union?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We have made a decision, and we\u2019ll be announcing it very soon.\u00a0 And it\u2019ll be 25 percent, generally speaking, and that\u2019ll be on cars and all other things.\u00a0\n\nAnd European Union is a different case than Canada \u2014 different kind of case.\u00a0 They\u2019ve really taken advantage of us in a different way.\u00a0 They don\u2019t accept our cars.\u00a0 They don\u2019t accept, essentially, our farm products.\u00a0 They use all sorts of reasons why not.\u00a0 And we accept everything of them, and we have about a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.\u00a0\n\nNow, I love the countries of Europe.\u00a0 I guess I\u2019m from there at some point, a long time ago, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But indirectly \u2014 well, pretty directly, too, I guess.\u00a0 But I love the countries of Europe.\u00a0 I \u2014 I love all countries, frankly.\u00a0 All different.\n\nBut European Union has been \u2014 it was formed in order to screw the United States.\u00a0 I mean, look, let\u2019s be honest.\u00a0 The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States.\u00a0 That\u2019s the purpose of it, and they\u2019ve done a good job of it, but now I\u2019m president.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What will happen if these countries or the EU retaliate?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They can\u2019t.\u00a0 I mean, they can try, but they can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China did.\u00a0 They imposed tariffs \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They are pledging to, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that are \u2014 went into effect, China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 But \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 on the \u2014 the 10th of February.\u00a0 Has there been any \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 impact that you\u2019ve been able to observe?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 No, they can do it, and they can try, but the numbers can never equal what ours, because we can go off.\u00a0 We are the pot of gold.\u00a0 We\u2019re the one that everybody wants.\u00a0 And they can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey.\u00a0 We don\u2019t buy anymore.\u00a0 And if that happens, we win.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you talking to Erik Prince about privatat- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 privatizing deportations?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I haven\u2019t.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019re in litigation with CBS News.\u00a0 Is this a case that you\u2019d like to see go to trial, or are you open a settelm- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 With who?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS, the \u2014 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 CBS?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, CBS did something that was amazing.\u00a0 Kamala was unable to answer a question properly, and they took the question that they asked, and they inserted an answer.\u00a0 They gave her an answer.\u00a0 This was two days before the election, right before \u2014 the Sunday night before the election.\u00a0 And they wrote out a \u2014 they put her words from another question that was asked about a half an hour later, and they put that into the question.\u00a0\n\nNobody\u2019s ever even heard of it before.\u00a0 Nobody\u2019s ever heard of anything like this before.\u00a0 But they then did it, they say, on numerous occasions.\u00a0 And the FCC is looking at it very strongly, and everybody\u2019s looking at it, and I\u2019m \u2014 but nobody\u2019s ever seen anything.\u00a0\n\nThink of it.\u00a0 They took her answers, and they changed them.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t mean they changed a word or two, or they cut off a half a sentence, or they cut off a couple of words.\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve had that happen too.\u00a0 But that, you \u2014 you just say \u2014 you know, then they say, \u201cWell, we want brevity.\u00a0 You know, we wanted to do it for time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would \u2014 would you encourage \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They took out her answer, and they inserted an entirely different answer that made her sound competent.\u00a0 And they did this, and nobody\u2019s ever \u2014 I thought I\u2019ve heard of everything when it comes to that stuff.\u00a0 No \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u00a0 Nobody has ever seen.\u00a0 So, we sued, and we are in discussions of settlement.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What would a number be?\u00a0 Like a hu- \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s a number that you would think would be appropriate?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u2019s the timeline and process \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I mean, it \u2014 look, it could have \u2014 it probably did affect the election.\u00a0 I mean, we won by a lot.\u00a0 As I said, \u201cToo big to rig.\u201d\u00a0 But it probably did affect the election.\u00a0 Yeah, probably could have won by more, but I could have lost the election because of that.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s \u2014 we have to get to honest elections.\u00a0 We have to go back to paper ballots.\u00a0 We have to go back to voter ID.\u00a0 One-day election, ideally, or short term, not these 48-day and 61-day elections where boxes are put in a room, and, \u201cOh, let\u2019s move the boxes, because we\u2019re putting in a new air conditioning system.\u201d\u00a0 Then you see the boxes move, and then you say, \u201cWell, where are all the boxes?\u201d\u00a0 You know, \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But would you \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u201cWhat happened to the boxes that never came back?\u201d\u00a0\n\nNo, our elections are extremely dishonest.\u00a0 We\u2019re the only country in the world that has mail-in voting and all of these different things that we put in.\u00a0 Nobody \u2014 no other country in the world has it.\u00a0\n\nYou know, France went to \u2014 they had some of the things that we had, and they went to same-day voting, all paper.\u00a0 And, you know, paper is very sophisticated now.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very sophisticated \u2014 it\u2019s a very sophisticated form of voting right now.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very safe form of voting.\u00a0\n\nYou know, the other thing is for the governors.\u00a0 I wish the governors would do it, because the paper ballots will cost 9 percent of the machines, and they\u2019re 100 percent.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019re \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 nothing\u2019s foolproof, but they\u2019re as close as you get.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0\n\nBut on the \u201c60 Minute\u201d thing, nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like it.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And would you link the FCC action to the litigation?\u00a0 I mean, does it make se- \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s linked, but probably the lawyers look at it, you know, because I know it\u2019s going along.\u00a0 FCC is headed by a very competent person, and you have some very competent people on the board, and so I think they\u2019re looking at it very seriously.\u00a0\n\nYeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, of all the deals that you\u2019ve done in your life, all the people you\u2019ve sat across from and negotiated with, is President Putin distinct in any way?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s a very smart guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very cunning person.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve dealt with some people that \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with some really bad people.\u00a0 But I will tell you, as far as this is concerned, we\u2019ve \u2014 you have to understand, he was \u2014 he had no intention, in my opinion, of settling this war.\u00a0 I think he wanted the whole thing.\u00a0\n\nWhen I got elected, we spoke, and I think we\u2019re going to have a deal.\u00a0 I can\u2019t guarantee you that.\u00a0 You know, a deal is a deal.\u00a0 Lots of crazy things happen in deals, right?\u00a0 But I think we\u2019re going to have a deal.\u00a0\n\nIf I didn\u2019t get elected, I believe he would have just continued to go through Ukraine, and over a period of time, a lot of people \u2014 a lot of people would have been killed.\u00a0 It would have lasted for a period of time.\u00a0\n\nAnd the reason that Ukraine \u2014 and I give \u2014 I have great respect for the Ukraine as fighters.\u00a0 They have great fighters.\u00a0 But without our equipment, that war would have been over, like people said, in a very short period of time.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there a timeline (inaudible) \u2014\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And if you remember, I gave the Javelins, and the Javelins are the things that knocked out those tanks right at the beginning of the war.\u00a0 They said that \u2014 that Obama, at the time, gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins.\u00a0 Well, I was the one that did that.\u00a0 But I want to see it come to an end.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will he have to make concessions \u2014 President Putin?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, he will.\u00a0 He will.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to have to.\u00a0 And \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you preview that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I think \u2014 I believe that, because we got elected, that war will come to an end.\u00a0 And I also believe, if we didn\u2019t get elected, if this administration didn\u2019t win the election by a lot, that that war would go on for a long time, and he would want to take the whole thing.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What concessions?\u00a0 What concessions?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the \u2014 on the \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The big question I had is: Does he want to take the whole thing?\u00a0 But the reason \u2014 and \u2014 and the Ukrainians are good fighters, I have to say, but without the equipment \u2014 without our equipment \u2014 we have the best equipment in the world.\u00a0 We have the best military equipment in the world.\u00a0 Without our equipment, that would have been over very quickly.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What concessions would you like to see?\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the (inaudible), sir?\u00a0 On \u2014 on the \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What concessions would you like to see?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, I don\u2019t want to tell right now.\u00a0 But I can tell you that NATO, you can forget about.\u00a0 That\u2019s been \u2014 I think that\u2019s probably the reason the whole thing started.\u00a0 And I think, JD, we can say that.\u00a0\n\nWhat \u2014 do you have a statement on that?\u00a0 You\u2019ve been very much involved.\u00a0\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I gave him the beauty.\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 You gave me the \u2014 the hardest question, sir.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concessions from Russia.\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I mean, look, as the president said, we\u2019re not going to do the negotiation in public with the American media.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to do it in private with the president of \u2014 of Russia, with the president of Ukraine, and with other leaders.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s how this has to go.\u00a0\n\nI think the \u2014 I just want to push back against some of the criticism I\u2019ve seen in the administration on this, because every single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t conceded anything to anyone.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing the job of a diplomat, and he is, of course, the diplomat in chief as the president of the United States.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the gold cards, sir.\u00a0 Can you talk a little bit more about the vetting process, you know \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They\u2019ll go through a process.\u00a0 The process is being worked out right now, and we\u2019re going to be \u2014 we\u2019re going to be very careful.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And will there be restrictions on, for instance, can Chinese nationals get one?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, we\u2019re not going to restrict.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can Iranian nationals get \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re probably not going to be restricting too much in \u2014 in terms of countries, but maybe in terms of individuals.\u00a0 We want to make sure we have people that love our country and are capable of loving the country.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there a process, sir \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, there is a measles outbreak in Texas at the moment in which a child is reported to have died.\u00a0 Do you have concerns about that?\u00a0 And have you asked Secretary Kennedy to look into that outbreak?\u00a0\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, why don\u2019t we \u2014 Bobby, do you want to speak on that, please?\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 We are following the measles epidemic every day.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas; mainly, we\u2019re told, in the Mennonite community.\u00a0\n\nThere are two people who have died, but the \u2014 we\u2019re watching it.\u00a0 And there \u2014 there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re watching it.\u00a0 We put out a post on it yesterday, and we\u2019re going to continue to follow it.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 Inci- \u2014 incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country.\u00a0 Last year, there were 16.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s not unusual.\u00a0 We have measles outbreaks every year.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You sound a little under the weather yourself right now.\u00a0 Are you all right?\n\nSECRETARY KENNEDY:\u00a0 I just \u2014 I have a permanently bad throat.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) coughing.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, would you \u2014 would you send U.S. peacekeepers to just \u2014 to support the \u2014 the European peacekeepers?\u00a0 Would you do any sort of U.S. \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, we\u2019re going to support Europe, yeah.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And how would we do that?\u00a0 How would the United States do that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re very friendly with Europe.\u00a0 We have a great relationship with Europe.\u00a0 I mean, you could ask \u2014 you could talk about France.\u00a0 You could talk about any of them.\u00a0 Yeah, we have a great relationship with Europe.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But how will we \u2014 how will the United States do that?\u00a0 Would there be boots on \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, how?\u00a0 I mean, you\u2019re asking me a question: What are we doing in the \u2014 let\u2019s worry \u2014 I hope we have that problem, where we can worry about peacekeeping.\u00a0 We got to get there first.\n\n(Secretary Lutnick knocks on the table.)\n\nBut I hope we have the problem of worrying about peacekeeping.\u00a0 That\u2019ll be the easiest problem, I think, JD, that we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think so, sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That would be part of the deal, presumably, that the Ukrainians \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 would want \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll do it at the time, but we\u2019ll \u2014 peacekeeping is very easy.\u00a0 It\u2019s making the deal that\u2019s very tough.\u00a0\n\nAnd, again, nobody was speaking to Russia at all.\u00a0 And, you know, probably a million and a half soldiers have been killed \u2014 close to a million and a half soldiers, not to mention a treme- \u2014 I will tell you, the \u2014 the thing with that horrible war that should have never started \u2014 it would have never started if I were president, and it didn\u2019t start for four years, and it was not even thought about starting.\u00a0 But the thing with that war is that you\u2019re highly underestimating the number of people that have been killed.\u00a0 Far more people have been killed in that war than you talk about.\u00a0 You know, you like to talk about numbers, like, a million people.\u00a0 Well, they had much more than a million soldiers killed.\n\nBut you have a lot of cities that have been knocked to the ground.\u00a0 They\u2019re demolition sites.\u00a0 Literally, demolition sites.\u00a0 Every single building is knocked to the ground, and a lot of people were killed in those buildings.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll hear a report, \u201cTwo people were minorly injured\u201d or \u201cjust injured a little bit.\u201d\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 People were killed by the thousands.\n\nAnd there are a lot more people killed in that war than the media wants to talk about, because Biden did a horrible, horrible job.\u00a0 He should have prevented that war.\u00a0 He could have prevented that war.\u00a0\n\nPutin would have never gone in.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He would have never gone in.\u00a0 That war would never have taken place if I were president.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think what people are trying to understand, Mr. President \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 is how would the United States \u2014 what would you be willing to do to support this European peacekeeping effort?\u00a0 Would there be \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Again, you\u2019re asking me the same question?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 How many times do you have to answer it?\u00a0 You\u2019re talking about after we make peace.\u00a0 Let me make peace first.\u00a0\n\nOnce we make peace, I\u2019ll give you all the answers you want.\u00a0 But how many times can you ask the same question?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on the Middle East.\u00a0 Did you receive \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is loosening the sanctions on \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, go ahead.\u00a0 Behind.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is loosening the sanctions on Russia a potential option as part of an overall deal?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Not now, no.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 We have sanctions on Russia.\u00a0 No, I want to see if we make a deal first.\u00a0 But I think we will.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had very \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But is it a bargaining chip, I\u2019m asking.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ve had very good conversations with President Putin.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had very good conversations with President Zelenskyy.\u00a0 And until four weeks ago, nobody had conversations with anybody.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even a consideration.\u00a0 Nobody thought you could make peace.\u00a0 I think you can.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, just \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But if Mr. Putin gets to keep his \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 just to bring this \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 the land that was claimed by force, if the Russians get to keep the territory that they \u2014 they claimed by force, doesn\u2019t that send a dangerous message, let\u2019s say, to China about Taiwan?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, okay.\u00a0 You try and take it away, right?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do the best we can.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides.\u00a0 But for Ukraine, we\u2019re going to try very hard to make a good deal so that they can get as much back as possible.\u00a0 We want to get as much back as possible.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, just to bring this full \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll cut it out after maybe this question.\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To bring this full circle, back to \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Unless it\u2019s a bad question, and then we\u2019ll (inaudible).\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And back to \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You always like to finish on a good one.\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But, sir, they want you to negotiate with them instead of President Putin.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 I know.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Back to the question about the \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They want to continue to talk about the peacekeepers.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019re \u2014 you have a lot of confidence in us, because you assume there\u2019s going to be peace.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s possible it doesn\u2019t work out.\u00a0 There is possibility.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I had \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But I hope it does, for the sake of humanity, because if you look at the pictures that I\u2019ve looked at, you don\u2019t want to look at them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Go ahead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had a question back on these cuts to the federal workforce.\u00a0 You mentioned you \u2014 you\u2019re interested in doing another round of this email.\u00a0 When would you like to\n\nsee that?\u00a0 What would be the deadline?\u00a0 And \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I think \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 this time, would it be mandatory?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think Elon \u2014 I think Elon wants to.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s a good idea because, you know, those people, as I said before, they\u2019re on the bubble.\u00a0 You got a lot of people that have not responded, so we\u2019re trying to figure out, do they exist?\u00a0 Who are they?\u00a0 And it\u2019s possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And if that happened, that\u2019s okay, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This country has gotten bloated and fat and disgusting and incompetently run.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think we had the worst president in the history of our country.\u00a0 He just left office.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s a disgrace.\u00a0 What he\u2019s done to our country by allowing millions of people to come into our country like that and all of the other things \u2014 the inflation, which he caused because of energy and stupid spending.\u00a0 To spend hundreds of millions, trillions and trillions of dollars on the Green New Scam \u2014 a total scam.\u00a0 I have the best energy people, the best environmental people in the world around this table, and they \u2014 they can\u2019t even believe he got away with it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then, in leaving office, to send $20 billion here and $20 million there and $10 million and $5 million, and they couldn\u2019t spend the money fast enough, and \u201cLet\u2019s get it out before Trump gets in.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just get it out to anybody.\u201d\u00a0 This is a disgrace to our nation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And you don\u2019t write the fair thing.\u00a0 But, look, you know the good news?\u00a0 The people see it, and that\u2019s why we won the election by so much.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Doug.\u00a0 Pulitzer Prize.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sir, how many peacekeepers are you going to send to \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow will it be?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SECRETARY LUTNICK:\u00a0 \u201cHow will you address this?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

  "summary": "On February 26, 2025, President Trump addressed his Cabinet in the White House about various policies and initiatives undertaken by his administration. The President highlighted the visit of President Zelenskyy from Ukraine to sign an important agreement concerning rare earth materials. He also commended the Cabinet members on significant achievements, including a reduction in illegal border crossings and efforts to balance the federal budget by reducing government waste and inefficiencies through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Elon Musk, involved with the DOGE, discussed progress in identifying government inefficiencies and fraudulent activities.\n\nThe President's remarks also touched upon various other key policy areas, such as handling international relations with Russia and Ukraine, which included negotiating peace agreements. He criticized the previous administration for certain policies and aimed to regain the financial expenditures made by the US in global conflicts. Immigration policy was revisited with a focus on introducing a new 'gold card' system aimed at facilitating the entry of high-skilled immigrants and reducing national debt. Additionally, Trump addressed tariffs on Canada, emphasizing economic imbalances and the protection of national interests.\n\nTrump's administration plans to intensify efforts across multiple domains such as improving energy policies, restoring executive controls, and putting strategic international measures in place. The administration's approach towards Israel's conflicts and the situation with Afghanistan and its military equipment were also mentioned. Overall, the Cabinet meeting underscored a comprehensive review of domestic and foreign policies aimed at what Trump described as reclaiming America's strength and fiscal responsibility.",
  "eli5": "President Trump is making plans to do things like fix how money is spent by the government, talk to other countries to stop fights, and figure out how to allow smart people from other countries to work here. He also wants to use less money for unnecessary things, like how your mom and dad might cut back on snacks to save money.",
