Trump Addresses the Threat to National Security from Imports of Copper\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\n**SECURING AMERICA\u2019S COPPER SUPPLY:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order launching an investigation into how copper imports threaten America\u2019s national security and economic stability.\n    - The Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\n    - This investigation will assess the national security risks arising from the United States\u2019 increasing dependence on imported copper, in all its forms, and the potential need for trade remedies to safeguard domestic industry.\n    - The investigation will culminate in a report identifying vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain and providing recommendations to enhance the resilience of America\u2019s domestic copper industry.\n\n**ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY:** President Trump recognizes that an overreliance on foreign copper, in all its forms, could jeopardize U.S. defense capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation.\n    - Copper is an essential material for national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience.       - Copper plays a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies like clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics.\n      - Copper is the Defense Department\u2019s second-most utilized material. \n    - Despite possessing ample copper reserves, America\u2019s smelting and refining capacity lags behind global competitors like China, which controls over 50% of global smelting.       - The United States isn\u2019t even in the top five nations in copper smelting capacity. \n    - America\u2019s reliance on copper imports has surged from virtually 0% in 1991 to 45% of consumption in 2024, heightening risks to supply chain security.\n    - Foreign overcapacity in smelting and refining, coupled with potential export restrictions from other nations, threaten to disrupt copper availability for U.S. defense and industry needs.\n\n**STRENGTHENING AMERICAN INDUSTRY:**This Executive Order builds on previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade policy serves the nation\u2019s long-term interests.\n    - On Day One, President Trump initiated his America First Trade Policy to make America\u2019s economy great again.\n    - President Trump signed proclamations to close existing loopholes and exemptions to restore a true 25% tariff on steel and elevate the tariff to 25% on aluminum.\n    - President Trump implemented a 10% additional tariff on imports from China in response to China\u2019s role in the border crisis. \u00a0\n    - President Trump unveiled the \u201cFair and Reciprocal Plan\u201d on trade to restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and counter non-reciprocal trade agreements.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPresident Trump signed a memorandum to safeguard American innovation, including the consideration of tariffs to combat digital service taxes (DSTs), fines, practices, and policies that foreign governments levy on American companies.\n",
  "summary": "On February 25, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to investigate the impact of copper imports on the national security and economic stability of the United States. The Executive Order instructs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This investigation aims to evaluate the risks connected to America's growing dependence on imported copper and determine whether trade remedies are required to protect the domestic copper industry.\n\nPresident Trump highlights the critical role that copper plays in national defense, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, while expressing concern over the United States' declining smelting and refining capabilities. With America importing 45% of its copper needs as of 2024, the investigation will explore vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain due to foreign overcapacity and potential export restrictions. This move is part of a broader effort by the administration to bolster American industry by revisiting trade policies and imposing tariffs to address international trade imbalances.",
