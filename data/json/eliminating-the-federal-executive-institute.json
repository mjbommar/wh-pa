Johnson more than 50 years ago, is a Government program purportedly designed to provide leadership training to bureaucrats.\u00a0 But bureaucratic leadership over the past half-century has led to Federal policies that enlarge and entrench the Washington, D.C., managerial class, a development that has not benefited the American family. \u00a0The Federal Executive Institute should therefore be eliminated to refocus Government on serving taxpayers, competence, and dedication to our Constitution, rather than serving the Federal bureaucracy.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Elimination of the Federal Executive Institute. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall take all necessary steps to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute, in accordance with applicable law.\n\n(b) \u00a0All prior Presidential or other executive branch documents establishing or requiring the existence of the Federal Executive Institute, including the Presidential Memorandum of May 9, 1968, regarding the Federal Executive Institute, and any applicable provisions of Executive Order 11348 of April 20, 1967 (Providing for the Further Training of Government Employees), are hereby revoked.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0General Provisions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 February 10, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "## Summary\n\nOn February 10, 2025, a presidential order was issued to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute, a government program established over 50 years ago during President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. The order cited the need for responsible use of taxpayer dollars and a focus on government initiatives that directly benefit the American people. The Federal Executive Institute was intended to provide leadership training for federal bureaucrats, but the order argues that such bureaucratic leadership has not served the interests of the American family.\n\nIn accordance with this directive, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management is tasked with dismantling the Federal Executive Institute, ensuring the process adheres to existing laws. Any previous documents or executive orders related to the establishment of this institute, like the Presidential Memorandum of 1968 and certain provisions from Executive Order 11348 of 1967, are revoked. The order also clarifies that it should not affect existing legal authorities or create any legal rights enforceable by parties against the U.S. government.",
