  "markdown": "[Articles](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/)\n\n# \t\t\t\t\tTrump Administration: Follow the Law\t\t\t\t\n\nFebruary 13, 2025\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump and his administration have a simple message: follow the law. Since taking office, the Trump Administration has wasted no time taking action against states and entities which have opted for defiance.\n\n**Here are only a few examples:**\n    - The Department of Education  has  launched  investigations into the California Interscholastic Federation and the Minnesota State High School League over their  failures  to comply with President Trump\u2019s  executive order  protecting girls in sports. The department has also  announced  probes into the widespread anti-Semitic harassment at five public universities across the country.\n    - The Department of Justice (DOJ)  has  sued  the State of New York and its top officials  over  their willful failure to comply with federal immigration laws. The DOJ has also  filed lawsuits  against the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago over their dangerous and illegal so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d policies.\n    - The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)  has  announced  referrals to the Office of Inspector General and the DOJ over a scheme by outgoing Biden EPA staffers to bury billions of dollars in federal funding at an outside financial institution in an effort to shield the funds from oversight and accountability.\n    - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  has  opened  an investigation into discriminatory DEI policies at Comcast \u2014 an entity which it regulates \u2014 following President Trump\u2019s  executive order  ending such policies. The FCC has also  taken action  against a Soros-backed, San Francisco-based radio station after the station broadcasted the locations of undercover federal immigration authorities conducting dangerous operations in the area, and has  launched  an investigation  into NPR and PBS over potential violations of federal laws.\n    - The Department of Homeland Security  has  \u201cclawed back\u201d  tens of millions of dollars in funds paid by rogue FEMA officials to house illegal aliens in luxury New York City hotels.\n",
  "summary": "The Trump administration, as of February 13, 2025, has taken decisive actions to enforce federal laws across several domains. The Department of Education has started investigations into certain educational bodies in California and Minnesota for non-compliance with an executive order protecting girls in sports, as well as probing anti-Semitic incidents in universities. The Department of Justice is actively suing states like New York and cities like Chicago for not adhering to federal immigration laws and policies.\n\nIn addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has involved the DOJ regarding hidden funds allegedly mishandled by outgoing staffers from the previous administration. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is investigating DEI policies at Comcast and has taken steps against certain radio stations for broadcasting sensitive information and potential federal law violations. Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security is recovering funds from FEMA officials who allegedly misused them to accommodate illegal immigrants in luxury hotels.\n\nOverall, the administration is emphasizing strict adherence to federal laws and taking legal actions against states and entities that conspire against or defy these laws. These moves target a range of issues from sports and discrimination policies to immigration and financial accountability.",
