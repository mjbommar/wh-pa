(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50\u00a0U.S.C. 1601 *et seq*.) (NEA), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section\u00a0301 of\u00a0title\u00a03, United States Code,\n\n     I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that the sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs has profound consequences on our Nation, endangering lives and putting a severe strain on our healthcare system, public services, and communities.\n\nThis challenge threatens the fabric of our society.\u00a0 Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities.\u00a0 Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs.\n\nDrug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are the world\u2019s leading producers of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illicit drugs, and they cultivate, process, and distribute massive quantities of narcotics that fuel addiction and violence in communities across the United States.\u00a0 These DTOs often collaborate with transnational cartels to smuggle illicit drugs into the United States, utilizing clandestine airstrips, maritime routes, and overland corridors.\u00a0 \n\nThe challenges at our southern border are foremost in the public consciousness, but our northern border is not exempt from these issues.\u00a0 Criminal networks are implicated in human trafficking and smuggling operations, enabling unvetted illegal migration across our northern border.\u00a0 There is also a growing presence of Mexican cartels operating fentanyl and nitazene synthesis labs in Canada.\u00a0 The flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl to the United States through both illicit distribution networks and international mail \u2014 due, in the case of the latter, to the existing administrative exemption from duty and taxes, also known as *de minimis*, under section 1321 of title 19, United States Code \u2014 has created a public health crisis in the United States, as outlined in the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2025 (America First Trade Policy) and Executive Order 14157 of January 20, 2025 (Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists).\u00a0 With respect to smuggling of illicit drugs across our northern border, Canada\u2019s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre recently published a study on the laundering of proceeds of illicit synthetic opioids, which recognized Canada\u2019s heightened domestic production of fentanyl, largely from British Columbia, and its growing footprint within international narcotics distribution.\u00a0 Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown.\u00a0 And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security seized, comparatively, much less fentanyl from Canada than from Mexico last year, fentanyl is so potent that even a very small parcel of the drug can cause many deaths and destruction to America families.\u00a0 In fact, the amount of fentanyl that crossed the northern border last year could kill 9.5 million Americans. \n\nImmediate action is required to finally end this public health crisis and national emergency, which will not happen unless the compliance and cooperation of Canada is assured.\n\nI hereby determine and order:\n\n Section 1.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the country and its citizens. A Nation without borders is not a nation at all.\u00a0 I will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, our citizens to be endangered, or our borders to be disrespected anymore.\n\nI previously declared a national emergency with respect to the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United States in Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border).\u00a0 Pursuant to the NEA, I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in that Proclamation to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs, other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\u00a0 In addition, this failure to act on the part of Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u00a0 I hereby declare and reiterate a national emergency under the NEA and IEEPA to deal with that threat.\u00a0 This national emergency requires decisive and immediate action, and I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of Canada set forth in this order.\u00a0 In doing so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA and specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat.\n\n Sec. 2. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 All articles that are products of Canada as defined by the *Federal Register* notice described in subsection (e) of this section (*Federal Register* notice), and except for those products described in subsection (b) of this section, shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty. \u00a0Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the *Federal Register* notice.\u00a0\n\n(b)\u00a0 With respect to energy or energy resources, as defined in section 8 of Executive Order 14156 of January 20, 2025 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), and as otherwise included in the *Federal Register*notice, such articles that are products of Canada as defined by the *Federal Register* notice shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty.\u00a0 Such rate of duty shall apply with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except that goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, after such time that were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading or in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 1, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty, only if the importer certifies to CBP as specified in the *Federal Register* notice.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n(c)\u00a0 The rates of duty established by this order are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, or charges applicable to such imported articles.\u00a0\n\n(d)\u00a0 Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\n\n(e)\u00a0 In order to establish the duty rate on imports of articles that are products of Canada, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the modifications necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the *Federal Register*.\u00a0 The modifications made to the HTSUS by this notice shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, and shall continue in effect until such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.\n\n(f)\u00a0 Articles that are products of Canada, except those that are eligible for admission under \u201cdomestic status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, which are subject to the duties imposed by this order and are admitted into a United States foreign trade zone on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on February 4, 2025, except as otherwise noted in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, must be admitted as \u201cprivileged foreign status\u201d as defined in 19 CFR 146.41.\u00a0 Such articles will be subject upon entry for consumption to the rates of duty related to the classification under the applicable HTSUS subheading in effect at the time of admittance into the United States foreign trade zone*.*\n\n(g)\u00a0 No drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this order.\u00a0\n\n(h)\u00a0 For avoidance of doubt, duty-free *de minimis* treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321 shall not be available for the articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Any prior Presidential Proclamation, Executive Order, or other Presidential directive or guidance related to trade with Canada that is inconsistent with the direction in this order is hereby terminated, suspended, or modified to the extent necessary to give full effect to this order.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 The articles described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) of this section shall exclude those encompassed by 50 U.S.C. 1702(b).\n\nSec. 3.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0The Secretary of Homeland Security shall regularly consult with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security on the situation at our northern border.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security shall inform the President of any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, indicate that the Government of Canada has taken adequate steps to alleviate this public health crisis through cooperative enforcement actions.\u00a0 Upon the President\u2019s determination of sufficient action to alleviate the crisis, the tariffs described in section 2 of this order shall be removed.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, shall recommend additional action, if necessary, should the Government of Canada fail to take adequate steps to alleviate the illegal migration and illicit drug crises through cooperative enforcement actions.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0 All executive departments and agencies shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.\n\n Sec. 5.\u00a0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency under IEEPA declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).\n\n Sec. 6.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of\u00a0Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United\u00a0States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 February 1, 2025.\n",
  "summary": "On February 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order to impose duties on Canadian products to address the flow of illicit drugs across the United States' northern border. Utilizing powers under several U.S. laws, the President determined that Canada has not effectively controlled drug trafficking contributing to a public health crisis in the U.S. Tariffs include a 25% ad valorem duty on most Canadian products and a 10% duty on energy resources, effective February 4, 2025. \n\nThis action is part of an initiative to curb the increase of synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs entering the U.S. from Canada\u2014an escalating issue that Canada has reportedly not managed adequately. The executive order involves collaboration between various U.S. departments and outlines punitive measures such as increased tariffs should Canada retaliate. The order also restricts duty-free exemptions for these goods and tasks U.S. Homeland Security officials with assessing and reporting Canada's compliance efforts.",
