EST\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Good afternoon, everybody.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good afternoon.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 How are we?\u00a0 Good to see all of you.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be here with all of you.\u00a0 A lot of familiar faces in the room, a lot of new faces.\n\nAnd President Trump is back, and the golden age of America has most definitely begun.\u00a0\n\nThe Senate has already confirmed five of President Trump\u2019s exceptional Cabinet nominees: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\u00a0 It is imperative that the Senate continues to confirm the remainder of the president\u2019s well-qualified nominees as quickly as possible.\n\nAs you have seen during the past week, President Trump is hard at work fulfilling the promises that he made to the American people on the campaign trail.\u00a0 Since taking the oath of office, President Trump has taken more than 300 executive actions; secured nearly $1 trillion in U.S. investments; deported illegal alien rapists, gang members, and suspected terrorists from our homeland; and restored common sense to the federal government.\n\nI want to take a moment to go through some of these extraordinary actions.\u00a0\n\nOn day one, President Trump declared a national emergency at our southern border to end the four-year-long invasion of illegal aliens under the previous administration.\u00a0 Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order to end catch and release and finish construction of his effective border wall.\u00a0 By using every lever of his federal power, President Trump has sent a loud and clear message to the entire world: America will no longer tolerate illegal immigration.\u00a0\n\nAnd this president expects that every nation on this planet will cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens, as proven by this weekend, when President Trump swiftly directed his team to issue harsh and effective sanctions and tariffs on the Colombian government upon hearing they were denied a U.S. military aircraft full of their own citizens who were deported by this administration.\u00a0 Within hours, the Colombian government agreed to all of President Trump\u2019s demands, proving America is once again respected on the world stage.\n\nSo, to foreign nationals who are thinking about trying to illegally enter the United States, think again.\u00a0 Under this president, you will be detained, and you will be deported.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals that President Trump\u2019s administration is removing from our communities.\n\nOn January 23rd, ICE New York arrested a Turkish national for entry without inspection who is a known or suspected terrorist. \u00a0On January 23rd, ICE San Francisco arrested a citizen of Mexico unlawfully present in the United States who has been convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child aged 14 years or younger.\u00a0 ICE Saint Paul has arrested a citizen of Honduras who was convicted of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.\u00a0 ICE Buffalo arrested a citizen of Ecuador who has been convicted of rape.\u00a0\n\nICE Boston arrested a citizen of the Dominican Republic who has a criminal conviction for second-degree murder.\u00a0 This criminal was convicted of murder for beating his pregnant wife to death in front of her five-year-old son.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And ICE Saint Paul also arrested a citizen of Mexico who was convicted of possessing pornographic material of a minor on a work computer.\n\nThese are the heinous individuals that this administration is removing from American communities every single day.\u00a0 And to the brave state and local law enforcement officers, CBP, and ICE agents who are helping in the facilitation of this deportation operation, President Trump has your back and he is grateful for your hard work.\n\nOn the economic front, President Trump took immediate action to lower costs for families who are suffering from four long years of the Biden administration\u2019s destructive and inflationary policies.\u00a0 President Trump ordered the heads of all executive departments and agencies to help deliver emergency price relief to the American people, untangle our economy from Biden\u2019s regulatory constraints, and end the reckless war on American energy.\n\nPresident Trump also signed sweeping executive orders to end the weaponization of government and restore common sense to the federal bureaucracy.\u00a0 He directed all federal agencies to terminate illegal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs to help return America to a merit-based society.\n\nPresident Trump also signed an executive order declaring it is now the policy of the federal government that there are only two sexes: male and female.\u00a0 Sanity has been restored.\n\nBefore I take your questions, I would like to point out to \u2014 all of you once again have access to the most transparent and accessible president in American history.\u00a0 There has never been a president who communicates with the American people and the American press corps as openly and authentically as the 45th and now 47th president of the United States.\u00a0\n\nThis past week, President Trump has held multiple news conferences, gaggled on Air Force One multiple times, and sat down for a two-part interview on Fox News, which aired last week.\u00a0 As Politico summed it up best, \u201cTrump is everywhere again,\u201d and that\u2019s because President Trump has a great story to tell about the legendary American revival that is well underway.\n\nAnd in keeping with this revolutionary media approach that President Trump deployed during the campaign, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media who are seated in this room, because apporting \u2014 according to recent polling from Gallup, Americans\u2019 trust in mass media has fallen to a record low.\u00a0 Millions of Americans, especially young people, have turned from traditional television outlets and newspapers to consume their news from podcasts, blogs, social media, and other independent outlets.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to our team that we share President Trump\u2019s message everywhere and adapt this White House to the new media landscape in 2025.\u00a0 To do this, I am excited to announce the following changes will be made to this historic James S. Brady Briefing Room, where Mr. Brady\u2019s legacy will endure.\n\nThis White House believes strongly in the First Amendment, so it\u2019s why our team will work diligently to restore the press passes of the 440 journalists whose passes were wrongly revoked by the previous administration.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re also opening up this briefing room to new media voices who produce news-related content and whose outlet is not already represented by one of the seats in this room.\u00a0 We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers, and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House.\u00a0 And you can apply now on our new website, WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia.\u00a0\n\nStarting today, this seat in the front of the room, which is usually occupied by the press secretary staff, will be called the \u201cnew media\u201d seat.\u00a0 My team will review the applications and give credentials to new media applicants who meet our criteria and pass United States Secret Service requirements to enter the White House complex.\n\nSo, in light of these announcements, our first questions for today\u2019s briefing will go to these new media members whose outlets, despite being some of the most viewed news websites in the country, have not been given seats in this room.\u00a0\n\nAnd before I turn to questions, I do have news directly from the president of the United States that was just shared with me in the Oval Office from President Trump directly \u2014 an update on the New Jersey drones: After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.\u00a0\n\nMany of these drones were also hobbyists \u2014 recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones.\u00a0 In meanti- \u2014 in the \u2014 in time, it got worse, due to curiosity.\u00a0 This was not the enemy.\u00a0 A \u2014 a statement from the president of the United States to start this briefing with some news.\n\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to questions, and we will begin with our new media members: Mike Allen from Axios, Matt Boyle from Breitbart.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mike, why don\u2019t you go ahead.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Karoline, does the president see anything fishy about DeepSeek, either its origins or its cost?\u00a0 And could China\u2019s ability to make these models quicker, cheaper affect our thinking about expanding generation data centers, chip manufacturing?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 The president was asked about DeepSeek last night on Air Force One when he gaggled for, I think, the third or fourth time throughout the weekend with members of the traveling press corps.\u00a0 The president said that he believes that this is a wake-up call to the American AI industry.\u00a0 The last administration sat on their hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program.\n\nAnd so, President Trump believes in restoring American AI dominance, and that\u2019s why he took very strong executive action this past week to sign executive orders to roll back some of the onerous regulations on the AI industry.\u00a0 And President Trump has also proudly appointed the first AI and crypto czar at this White House, David Sacks, whom I spoke with yesterday \u2014 very knowledgeable on this subject.\u00a0 And his team is here working every single day to ensure American AI dominance.\n\nAs for the national security implications, I spoke with NSC this morning.\u00a0 They are looking into what those may be, and when I have an update, I will share it with you, Mike.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, Karoline, you say \u201crestore\u201d U.S. dominance.\u00a0 Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind?\u00a0 And how would the president make sure the U.S. stays ahead?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 The president is confident that we will restore American dominance in AI.\u00a0\n\nMatt.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans.\u00a0 The thing I would add \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2019ve got a two-part question for you.\u00a0 The first is just: Can you expand upon what steps the White House is going to take to bring more voices, not less \u2014 which is what our founder, Andrew Breitbart, believed in \u2014 into this room, where they rightly belong?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah, absolutely.\u00a0 And as I said in my opening statement, Matt, it is a priority of this White House to honor the First Amendment.\u00a0 And it is a fact that Americans are consuming their news media from various different platforms, especially young people.\u00a0 And as the youngest press secretary in history, thanks to President Trump, I take great pride in opening up this room to new media voices to share the president\u2019s message with as many Americans as possible.\n\nIn doing so, number one, we will ensure that outlets like yours \u2014 Axios and Breitbart, which are widely respected and viewed outlets \u2014 have an actual seat in this room every day.\u00a0 We also, again, encourage anybody in this country \u2014 whether you are a TikTok content creator, a blogger, a podcaster \u2014 if you are producing legitimate news content, no matter the medium, you will be allowed to apply for press credentials to this White House.\u00a0\n\nAnd as I said earlier, our new media website is WhiteHouse.gov/NewMedia, and so we encourage people to apply.\u00a0 Again, as long as you are creating news-related content of the day and you\u2019re a legitimate independent journalist, you\u2019re welcome to cover this White House.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And secondly, Karoline, you sa- \u2014 you laid out several of the actions that President Trump has taken.\u00a0 Obviously, it\u2019s a stark contrast to the previous administration and a breakneck speed from President Trump.\u00a0 Can we expect that pace to continue as the hun- \u2014 the \u2014 you know, the first 100 days moves along here and beyond that?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 There is no doubt President Trump has always been the hardest working man in politics.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s been proven over the past week.\u00a0 This president has, again, signed more than 300 executive orders.\u00a0 He\u2019s taken historic action.\u00a0\n\nI gaggled aboard Air Force One to mark the first 100 days of this administration \u2014 4:00 p.m. last Friday \u2014 first 100 hours, rather.\u00a0 And this president did more in the first 100 hours than the previous president did in the first 100 days.\u00a0\n\nSo, President Trump, I think you can all expect to \u2014 for him to continue to work at this breakneck speed.\u00a0 So, I hope you\u2019re all ready to work very hard.\u00a0 I know that we are.\n\nZeke Miller.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Karoline.\u00a0 A question that we\u2019ve asked your predecessors of both parties in this job.\u00a0 When you\u2019re up here in this briefing room speaking to the American public, do you view yourself and your role as speaking on \u2014 advocating on behalf of the president, or providing the unvarnished truth that is, you know, not to lie, not to obfuscate to the American people?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day.\u00a0 I commit to speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.\u00a0 That is my job.\u00a0\n\nAnd I will say it\u2019s very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people, and that\u2019s exactly what this administration is doing.\u00a0 It\u2019s correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room.\u00a0 I will not do that.\n\nBut since you brought up truth, Zeke, I would like to point out, while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard.\u00a0 We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family, and we will not accept that.\u00a0 We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House.\u00a0\n\nSo, yes, I will hold myself to the truth, and I expect everyone in this room to do the same.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, Karoline, just on a substantive question.\u00a0 Yesterday, the White House Office of Management and Budget directed an across-the-board freeze with \u2014 with some exceptions for individual assistance.\u00a0 We understand just federal grants.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s caused a lot of confusion around the country among Head Start providers, among providers \u2014 from services to homeless veterans, provid- \u2014 you know, Medicaid providers, states saying they\u2019re having trouble accessing the portal.\u00a0 Could you put \u2014 help us clear up some confusion \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 give some certainty to folks?\u00a0 And then also, is that uncertainty \u2014 how does that uncertainty service the president\u2019s voters?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Well, I think there\u2019s only uncertainty in this room amongst the media.\u00a0 There\u2019s no uncertainty in this building.\u00a0\n\nSo, let me provide the certainty and the clarity that all of you need.\u00a0 This is not a blanket pause on federal assistance in grant programs from the Trump administration.\u00a0 Individual assistance, that includes \u2014 I\u2019m not naming everything that\u2019s included, but just to give you a few examples \u2014 Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits \u2014 assistance that is going directly to individuals will not be impacted by this pause.\u00a0\n\nAnd I want to make that very clear to any Americans who are watching at home who may be a little bit confused about some of the media reporting: This administration \u2014 if you are receiving individual assistance from the federal government, you will still continue to receive that.\u00a0\n\nHowever, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.\u00a0 That is something that President Trump campaigned on.\u00a0 That\u2019s why he has launched DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, who is working alongside OMB.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why OMB sent out this memo last night, because the president signed an executive order directing OMB to do just this.\u00a0 And the reason for this is to ensure that every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken.\u00a0\n\nSo, what does this pause mean?\u00a0 It means no more funding for illegal DEI programs.\u00a0 It means no more funding for the Green New Scam that has ta- \u2014 cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\u00a0 It means no more funding for transgenderism and wokeness across our federal bureaucracy and agencies.\u00a0 No more funding for Green New Deal social engineering policies.\u00a0 Again, people who are receiving individual asintan- \u2014 assistance, you will continue to receive that.\n\nAnd President Trump is looking out for you by issuing this pause because he is being good steward of your taxpayer dollars.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Karoline.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How long is this pause going to last?\u00a0 And how is the Trump administration recommending that organizations that rely on federal funding make payroll, pay their rent in the meantime?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 It is a temporary pause, and the Office of Management and Budget is reviewing the federal funding that has been going out the door, again, not for individual assistance, but for all of these other programs that I mentioned.\n\nI also spoke with the incoming director of OMB this morning, and he told me to tell all of you that the line to his office is open for other federal government agencies across the board, and if they feel that programs are necessary and in line with the president\u2019s agenda, then the Office of Management and Budget will review those policies.\u00a0\n\nI think this is a very responsible measure.\u00a0 Again, the past four years, we\u2019ve seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big reason we\u2019ve had an inflation crisis in this country, and it\u2019s incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted for honestly.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why impose this pause with so little notice?\u00a0 Why not give organizations more time to plan for the fact that they are about to lose, in some cases, really crucial federal funding \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 There was \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 at least for a \u2014 for a period of time?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 There was notice.\u00a0 It was the executive order that the president signed.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also a freeze on hiring, as you know; a regulatory freeze; and there\u2019s also a freeze on foreign aid.\u00a0 And this is a \u2014 again, incredibly important to ensure that this administration is taking into consideration how hard the American people are working.\u00a0 And their tax dollars actually matter to this administration.\u00a0\n\nYou know, just during this pause, DOGE and OMB have actually found that there was $37 million that was about to go out the door to the World Health Organization, which is an organization, as you all know, that President Trump, with the swipe of his pen in that executive order, is \u2014 no longer wants the United States to be a part of.\u00a0 So, that wouldn\u2019t be in line with the president\u2019s agenda.\u00a0\n\nDOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.\u00a0 That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money.\u00a0\n\nSo, that\u2019s what this pause is focused on: being good stewards of tax dollars.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And so, this doesn\u2019t affect \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Jennifer.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Meals on Wheels or Head Start or disaster aid?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Again, it does not affect individual assistance that\u2019s going to Americans.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To follow up on Nancy, do you think there will be a list of who is affected and how much money is affected?\u00a0 How \u2014 how will these contractors and organizations know if they are actually being \u2014 having their funding frozen?\n\nAnd then, secondly, if you\u2019re willing, can you just clarify, is the end goal of this to essentially challenge Congress or to \u2014 to prove that the president can withhold federal funding?\u00a0 Is \u2014 in other words, is this an attempt to pick a fight to prove that he can do this?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 No, absolutely not.\u00a0 As it says right here in the memo, which I have \u2014 and I\u2019d encourage all of you to read it \u2014 it says, \u201cThe American people elected President Trump to be the president of the United States and gave him a mandate to increase the impact of every federal dollar.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThis memo requires federal agencies to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the president\u2019s policies and requirements.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe American people gave President Trump an overwhelming mandate on November 5th, and he\u2019s just trying to ensure that the tax money going out the door in this very bankrupt city actually aligns with the will and the priorities of the American people.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nBrian Glenn.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Welcome.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You look great.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing a great job.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You talked about transparency.\u00a0 And some of us in this room know how just transparent President Trump has been the last five or six years; I think you\u2019ll do the same.\u00a0\n\nMy question is, do you think this latest incident with the president of Colombia is indicative of the global, powerful respect they have for President Trump moving forward not only to engage in \u2014 in economic diplomacy with these countries but also world peace?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 I\u2019ll echo the answer that the president gave on Air Force One last night when he was asked a very similar question by one of your colleagues in the media: This signifies peace through strength is back, and this president will not tolerate illegal immigration into America\u2019s interior.\u00a0\n\nAnd he expects every nation on this planet, again, to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens who illegally entered into our country and broke America\u2019s laws.\u00a0 Won\u2019t be tolerated.\u00a0\n\nAnd as you saw, the Colombian government quickly folded and agreed to all of President Trump\u2019s demands.\u00a0 Flights are underway once again.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nDiana.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two questions on deportations, if I may.\u00a0 President Trump had said on the campaign trail that he would deport pro-Hamas students who are here on visas, and on his first day in office, he signed an executive order that said, quote, \u201cThe U.S. must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the U.S. do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.\u201d\u00a0 So, should we take this executive order as Trump saying he would be open to de- \u2014 deporting those students who are here on visas, but, you know, hold pro-Hamas sympathies?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president is open to deporting individuals who have broken our nation\u2019s immigrations laws.\u00a0 So, if they are here illegally, then certainly he is open to deporting them, and that\u2019s what this administration is hard at work at doing.\u00a0\n\nWe receive data from DHS and from ICE every single day.\u00a0 From what we hear on the ground, ICE agents are feeling incredibly empowered right now because they actually have a leader in this building who is supporting them in doing their jobs that they were hired to do, which is to detain, arrest, and deport illegal criminals who have invaded our nation\u2019s borders over the past four years.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the president is committed to seeing.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One more.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Peter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just following up on that, Karoline \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, if I could ask you very quickly, just following up on the question on immigration.\u00a0 First, President Trump, during the course of the campaign in 2024, said the following about illegal im- \u2014 immigration.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThey\u2019re going back home where they belong, and we start with the criminals.\u00a0 There are many, many criminals.\u201d\u00a0 NBC News has learned that ICE arrested 1,179 undocumented immigrants on Sunday, but nearly half of them \u2014 566 of the migrants \u2014 appear to have no prior criminal record besides entering the country illegally.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is the president still focused exclusiv- \u2014 which is a civil crime, not a \u2014 not a \u2014 it\u2019s not criminal \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 It\u2019s a federal crime.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s a fed- \u2014 so, I\u2019m asking though, he said he was going to focus on those violent offenders first.\u00a0 So, is violent offenders no longer the predicate for these people to be deported?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president has said countless times on the campaign trail \u2014 I\u2019ve been with him at the rallies; I know you\u2019ve been there covering them too, Peter \u2014 that he is focused on launching the largest mass deportation operation in American history of illegal criminals.\u00a0\n\nAnd if you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are, by definition, a criminal.\u00a0 And so, therefore \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, to be clear, it\u2019s not exclusively \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 \u2014 you are subject deportation.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I apologize for interrupting.\u00a0 So, to be clear, it\u2019s not \u2014 violent criminals do not receive precedence in terms of the deportations taking place?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president has also said \u2014 two things can be true at the same time.\u00a0 We want to deport illegal criminals, illegal immigrants from this country.\u00a0 But the president has said that, of course, the illegal dr- \u2014 criminal drug dealers, the rapists, the murderers, the individuals who have committed heinous acts on the interior of our country and who have terrorized law-abiding American citizens, absolutely, those should be the priority of ICE.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean that the other illegal criminals who entered our nation\u2019s borders are off the table.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Understood.\u00a0 Then let me ask you a separate question about the confusion that still exists across the country right now as it relates to the \u2014 the freeze \u2014 or the pause, as it\u2019s described.\u00a0 President Trump, of course, ran \u2014 one of the key policy items was that he was going to lower prices, lower the cost of everything from groceries, as he often said.\u00a0 But in many of the cases, it would seem that some of these moves could raise prices for real Americans on everything from low-income heating \u2014 that program; childcare programs.\u00a0 Will nothing that the president is doing here, in terms of the freeze in these programs, raise prices on ordinary Americans?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 What particular actions are you referring to that would \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m referring to LHEAP right now.\u00a0 That\u2019s the low-income heating program, for example.\u00a0 We can talk about \u2014 there\u2019s no clarity, so I could refer to a lot of them. \u00a0We don\u2019t know what they are specifically.\u00a0 Can you tell us that LHEAP \u2014 that LIHEAP is not one of those affected?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 So, you\u2019re asking a hypoc- \u2014 -thetical based on programs that you can\u2019t even identify?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, I just identified \u2014 I \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 What I can tell you is that the \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, just to be \u2014 just to be clear, since you guys haven\u2019t identified, let\u2019s do it together, just for Americans at home.\u00a0 Medicaid, is that affected?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I gave you a list of examples \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, welfare benefits \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Medicaid too, correct?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 \u2014 food stamps \u2014 that will not be impacted by this federal pause.\u00a0 I can get you the full list after this briefing from the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBut I do want to address the cost cutting, because that\u2019s certainly very important, and \u2014 and cutting the cost of living in this country.\u00a0 President Trump has taken historic action over the past week to do that.\u00a0 He actually signed a memorandum to deliver emergency price relief for American families, which took a number of actions.\u00a0 I can walk you through those.\u00a0\n\nHe also repealed many onerous Biden administration regulations.\u00a0 We know, over the past four years, American households has been essentially taxed $55,000 in regulations from the previous administration.\u00a0 President Trump, with the swipe of his pen, rescinded those, which will ultimately put more money back in the pockets of the American people.\u00a0 So, deregulation is a big deal.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, when it comes to energy, I mean, the president signed an executive order to declare a national energy emergency here at home, which is going to make America energy dominant.\u00a0 We know that energy is one of the number-one drivers of inflation, and so that\u2019s why the president wants to increase our energy supply: to bring down costs for Americans.\u00a0 The Trump energy boom is incoming, and Americans can expect that.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please share that memo.\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I will.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, I think \u2014 some of the confusion, I think, may be here with this pause on federal funding.\u00a0 You\u2019ve made it clear you\u2019re not stopping funds that go directly to individuals, but there certainly are lots of organizations that receive funding and then may pass along a benefit \u2014 Meals on Wheels, for one.\u00a0 They provide meals for over 2.2 million seniors.\u00a0\n\nWhat is the president\u2019s message to Americans out there, many of whom supported him and voted for him, who are concerned that this is going to impact them directly, even if, as you said, the funding isn\u2019t coming directly to their wallet?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I have now been asked and answered this question four times.\u00a0 To individuals at home who receive direct assistance from the federal government, you will not be impacted by this federal freeze.\u00a0 In fact, OMB just sent out a memo to Capitol Hill with Q and A to \u2014 to clarify some of the questions and the answers that all of you are a- \u2014 are asking me right now.\u00a0\n\nAgain, direct assistance will not be impacted.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been asked and answered about this OMB memo.\u00a0 There\u2019s many other topics of the day.\u00a0\n\nJacqui Heinrich.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But on indirect assistance, Karoline \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 if it\u2019s going to another organization and then trickling down?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted.\u00a0\n\nAgain, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition.\u00a0 But OMB right now is focused on analyzing the federal government\u2019s spending, which is exactly what the American people elected President Trump to do.\u00a0\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And one question on immigration, Karoline.\u00a0 On immigration.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karo- \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers?\u00a0 How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 All of them, because they illegally broke our nation\u2019s laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes.\u00a0 I know the last administration didn\u2019t see it that way, so it\u2019s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal.\u00a0 But that\u2019s exactly what they are.\u00a0\n\nJacqui.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, on tariffs.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But you made a point of going with the worst first.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On tariffs.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They all have a criminal record?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And welcome to the briefing room.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 If they broke our nation\u2019s laws, yes, they are a criminal.\u00a0\n\nYes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 On stripping security details for figures like John Bolton, Pompeo, Brian Hook.\u00a0 Senator Tom Cotton said that he\u2019s seen the intelligence and the threat from Iran is real for anyone who played a role in the Soleimani strike.\u00a0 He voiced concern it wouldn\u2019t just impact those individuals but potentially their family, innocent bystanders, friends \u2014 anyone who is near them when they\u2019re out in public.\u00a0 Is the president open to reconsidering his decision?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president was asked and answered this yesterday, and he was firm in his decision, despite some of the comments that you had referenced.\u00a0 And he\u2019s made it very clear that he does not believe American taxpayers should fund security details for individuals who have served in the government for the rest of their lives.\u00a0 And there\u2019s nothing stopping these individuals that you mentioned from obtaining private security.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s where the president stands on it.\u00a0 I have no updates on that.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there any concern that this decision might jeopardize the administration\u2019s ability to hire the best advisers for these kinds of positions in the future?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019ve talked to the Presidential Personnel Office who has told me directly that there is such an influx of resumes for this administration that it\u2019s incredibly overwhelming.\u00a0 There is no lack of talent for the Trump administration.\u00a0\n\nReagan Ree- \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And would he \u2014 would he take any responsibility \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Karoline.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 if anything happened to these people?\u00a0 Would he feel at all that his decision was a factor in that?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president was asked and answered this yesterday.\u00a0 I\u2019d defer you to his comments.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Karoline.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Reagan, since you\u2019re in the back row, I hear y- \u2014 the back row hasn\u2019t gotten much attention in the last four years \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, thank you.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 \u2014 so I\u2019m happy to answer your question.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I can project.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\n\nDoes the president intend to permanently cut off funding to NGOs that are bringing illegal foreign nationals to the country, such as Catholic Charities?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I am actually quite certain that the president signed an executive order that did just that, and I can point you to that.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One more, Karoline.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump issued an executive order on increased vetting for refugees in visa applications.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part of that order was considering an outright ban for countries that have deficient screening processes.\u00a0 Has the president considered yet which countries might fall into this category?\u00a0 Are countries like Afghanistan or Syria under consideration for a full ban?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 So, the president signed an executive order to streamline the vetting for visa applicants and for illegal immigrants in this country who are coming, of course, from other nations.\u00a0\n\nIt also directed the secretary of State to review the process and make sure that other countries around the world are being completely transparent with our nation and the individuals that they are sending here.\u00a0 And so, the secretary of State has been directed to report back to the president.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen that report yet.\u00a0 We\u2019ve only been here for a few days.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, two questions for you.\u00a0 One on the freeze in federal funding.\u00a0 Who advised the president on the legality of telling government agencies that they don\u2019t have to spend money that was already appropriated by Congress?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Well, as the OMB memo states, this is certainly within the confines of the law.\u00a0\n\nSo, White House Counsel\u2019s Office believes that this is within the pe- \u2014 president\u2019s power to do it, and therefore, he\u2019s doing it.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So, they disagree with lawmakers who say that they don\u2019t have the power to \u2014 to freeze this funding?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Again, I would point you to the language in the memo that clearly states this is within the law.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And on what happened on Friday night.\u00a0 The \u2014 the administration fired several inspectors general without giving Congress the 30-day legally required notification that they were being fired.\u00a0 I think only two were left at DO- \u2014 DHS and the DOJ.\u00a0 And then, yesterday, we saw several prosecutors \u2014 I believe 12 \u2014 fired from the Justice Department who worked on the investigations into the president.\u00a0 As you know, they are career prosecutors; therefore, they are afforded civil service protections.\u00a0 How is the administration deciding which laws to follow and which ones to ignore?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 So, it is the belief of this White House and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office that the president was within his exe- \u2014 executive authority to do that.\u00a0 He is the executive of the executive branch, and, therefore, he has the power to fire anyone within the executive branch that he wishes to.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also a case that went before the Supreme Court in 2020: ~~Scaila~~ [Seila] Law LLC, v. the Customs \u2014 the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau ~~Protection~~.\u00a0 I would advise you to look at that case, and that\u2019s the legality that this White House has rested on.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, you\u2019re confident that if they bring lawsuits against you \u2014 those prosecutors who were fired \u2014 that \u2014 that they will succeed?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 We will win in court, yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And did he personally direct this, given they worked on the classified documents investigation and the election interference investigation?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 This was a memo that went out by the Presidential Personnel Office, and the president is the leader of this White House.\u00a0 So, yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, it did come from him?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yes, it came from this White House.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sir.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Congrats on your first day behind the podium.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump ended funding for UNRWA and also designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both were decisions that the previous administration had reversed.\u00a0 So, here\u2019s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s a very good point.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard discussions about such an ins- \u2014 investigation, but it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, considering that the Houthis cer- \u2014 certainly are terrorists.\u00a0 They have launched attacks on U.S. naval ships across this world, and so I think it was a very wise move by this administration to redesignate them as a terrorist group, because they are.\u00a0 And I think it was a foolish decision by the previous administration to do so.\u00a0\n\nAs for an investigation, I\u2019m not sure about that, but it\u2019s not a bad idea.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nJosh.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for the question.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Can you give us an update on the president\u2019s plan for his tariff agenda?\u00a0 He spoke a lot about this yesterday, and there\u2019s a couple of dates coming up that \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Sure.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 he\u2019s spoken to.\u00a0 Number one, February 1st.\u00a0 He\u2019s alluded to both the potential for tariffs for Canada and Mexico but also China to take effect on those days.\u00a0 Where is \u2014 what\u2019s he thinking about that?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Should those countries expect that on the 1st?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Again, he was asked and answered this question this past weekend when he took a lot of questions from the press, and he said that the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico still holds.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what about the China 10 percent tariff that he also had mused about last Tuesday going into effect on the same date?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah, the president has said that he is very much still considering that for February 1st.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then, separately, yesterday, he talked also about sectoral tariffs on, for instance, pharmaceuticals, as well as semiconductor computer chips.\u00a0 He talked about steel, aluminum, and copper.\u00a0 What\u2019s the timeline on those?\u00a0 Is that a similar sort of \u201ccoming days\u201d thing or \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah, so when the president talked about that in his speech yesterday, that actually wasn\u2019t a new announcement.\u00a0 That was within a presidential memorandum that he signed in one of the first days here in the White House on his America First trade agenda.\u00a0 So, there\u2019s more details on those tariffs in there.\n\nAs far as a date, I don\u2019t have a specific date to read out to you, but the president is committed to implementing tariffs effectively, just like he did in his first term.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then \u2014 and then, finally, he also was asked on the plane when he gaggled about the potential for a universal tariff.\u00a0 He was asked maybe about two and a half percent.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a report about that.\u00a0 He said he wanted \u201cmuch bigger than that.\u201d\u00a0 Should we understand that these tariffs would add up?\u00a0 You know, in other words, you might have country-specific tariffs like Canada, Mexico, China.\u00a0 You might have sectoral tariffs, like on pharmaceuticals, as well as a potential universal tariff on top of that.\u00a0 Do these stack on one or the other, or would one sort of take precedence over another?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 All I can point you to is what the president has said on this front: the February 1st date for Canada and Mexico and also the China tariff that he has discussed.\n\nHe rejected the 2.5 percent tariff. \u00a0He said that was a little bit too low.\u00a0 He wants it to be higher.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to him to make any decisions on that front.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any comment on what the \u2014\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 what the Mexicans and Canadians \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Phil.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 have done so far?\u00a0 Do you have any comment on whether that has met the bar of what he wants to see on fentanyl?\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0\u00a0 I \u2014 I won\u2019t get ahead of the president, again, on advocating to foreign nations on what they should or shouldn\u2019t do to get away from these tariffs.\u00a0 The president has made it very clear, again, that he expects every nation around this world to cooperate with the repatriation of their citizens.\u00a0 And the president has also put out specific statements in terms of Canada and Mexico when it comes to what he expects in terms of border security.\n\nWe have seen a historic level of cooperation from Mexico.\u00a0 But, again, as far as I\u2019m still tracking \u2014 and that was last night talking to the president directly \u2014 February 1st is still on the books.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Phil.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 Quick programming note, and then a question on taxes.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 A programming note.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, in terms of programming, should \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 That sounds fun.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 we expect to see you here every day?\u00a0 How frequently will these \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s a good question.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 press briefings be?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 It is a good question, April.\n\nSo, look, the president, as you know, is incredibly accessible.\u00a0 First day here, he wanted all of you in the Oval Office.\u00a0 You got a 60-minute press conference with the leader of the free world \u2014 while he was simultaneously signing executive orders, I may add.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty impressive.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the previous office holder would be able to pull such a thing off.\u00a0\n\nSo, look, the president is the best spokesperson that this White House has, and I can assure you that you will be hearing from both him and me as much as possible.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then a question about tax cuts.\u00a0 You know, the president has promised to extend the tax cuts from the previous term.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious, you know, does the president support corresponding spending cuts, as some Republicans have called for in Congress?\u00a0 And will the new Treasury secretary be leading those negotiations with the Hill, as Mnuchin did during the first administration?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The president is committed to both tax cuts and spending cuts.\n\nAnd he has a great team negotiating on his behalf, but there\u2019s no better negotiator than Donald Trump, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be involved in this reconciliation process as it moves forward.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, in the announcement that you made last night on the Iron Dome, it said the president had directed that the United States will build this Iron Dome.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you read into the executive order, it seemed short of that.\u00a0 It asked for a series of studies \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yeah.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and reports back on \u2014 can you tell us whether the president has directed this and, if he is this concerned on this issue, why the suspensions that we saw listed by OMB included so many different nuclear programs, nonproliferation programs, programs to blend down nuclear weapons, and s- \u2014 and so forth?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 First of all, when it comes to the Iron Dome, the executive order directed the implementation of the \u2014 of an Iron Dome.\u00a0 It also, as you said, kind of directed research and studies to see if \u2014 or \u2014 or how the United States can go about doing this, particularly the Department of Defense.\n\nWhen it comes to the other question that you asked about those specific programs, again, I would say, this is not a \u2014 a ban; this is a temporary pause and a freeze to ensure that all of the money going out from Washington, D.C., is in align with the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nAnd as the Office of Management and Budget has updates on what will be kick-started, once again, I will provide those to you.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you clarify for a sec what you were saying before on Medicaid?\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t clear to me whether you were saying that no Medicaid would be cut off.\u00a0 Obviously, a lot of this goes to states before it goes to individuals and so forth.\u00a0 So, are you guaranteeing here that no individual now on Medicaid would see a cutoff because of the pause?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll check back on that and get back to you.\u00a0\n\nJon.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks a lot, Karoline.\u00a0 As you know, in the first week that the president was in office, signed an executive order as it relates to birthright citizenship \u2014 trying to eliminate that.\u00a0 Now, 22 state attorney generals have said that this is unconstitutional.\u00a0 A federal judge has just agreed with their argument.\u00a0 What\u2019s the administration\u2019s argument for doing away with birthright citizenship?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The folks that you mentioned have a right to have that legal opinion, but it is in disagreement with the legal opinion of this administration.\u00a0\n\nThis administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, and that is why President Trump signed that executive order.\u00a0 Illegal immigrants who come to this country and have a child are not subject to the laws of this jurisdiction.\u00a0 That\u2019s the opinion of this administration.\u00a0\n\nWe have already appealed the rul- \u2014 the lawsuit that was filed against this administration, and we are prepared to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to, because President Trump believes that this is a necessary step to secure our nation\u2019s borders and protect our homeland.\u00a0\n\nMonica.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then on foreign policy \u2014 on foreign policy, Karoline \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to see you, and you\u2019re doing a great \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 on foreign policy, if I may.\u00a0 The president\u2019s commitment to the NATO defense Alliance, is it as strong as the prior administration?\u00a0 Is it the same as when he served as president in his first term in office?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 As long as NATO pays their fair share.\n\nAnd President Trump has called on NATO Allies to increase their defense spending to 5 percent.\u00a0 You actually saw the head of NATO at Davos last week on Bloomberg Television saying that President Trump is right and if Europe wants to keep itself safe, they should increase their defense spending.\u00a0\n\nI would just add that there was no greater ally to our European allies than President Trump in his first term.\u00a0 The world, for all nations in Europe, and, of course, here at home was much safer because of Presidents Tru- \u2014 Trump\u2019s peace through strength diplomatic approach.\u00a0\n\nMonica.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 And it\u2019s great to finally be called on as well in the briefing room.\u00a0 I appreciate that.\u00a0\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 You\u2019re welcome.\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, we know President Trump just got back from North Carolina and California meeting with victims of natural disasters.\u00a0 There\u2019s the two-year anniversary of the East Palestine, Ohio, toxic train derailment.\u00a0 Does the president have any plans to go visit the victims of that toxic spill or just visit in general?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Not \u2014 no plans that I can read out for you here.\u00a0 If that changes, I will certainly keep you posted.\u00a0\n\nWhat I can tell you is that President Trump still talks about his visit to East Palestine, Ohio.\u00a0 That was one of the turning points, I would say, in the previous election campaign, where Americans were reminded that President Trump is a man of the people.\u00a0 And he, as a candidate, visited that town that was just derailed by the train derailment \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 and he offered support and hope, just like I saw the president do this past week.\u00a0\n\nIt was a purposeful decision by this president, on his first domestic trip, to go to North Carolina and to California to visit with Americans who were impacted by Hurricane Helene and also by the deadly fires \u2014 a red state and a blue state, both of which feel forgotten by the previous administration and the federal government.\u00a0 That has now \u2014 that has now ended under President Trump.\u00a0\n\nHe will continue to put Americans first, whether they\u2019re in East Palestine, in Pacific Palisades, or in North Carolina.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nSure.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Karoline.\u00a0 On California, could you please clarify what the military did with the water last night, as referenced in the president\u2019s Truth Social post?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 The water has been turned back on in California, and this comes just days after President Trump visited Pacific Palisades and, as you all saw, applied tremendous pressure on state and local officials in Pacific Palisades, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, to turn on the water and to direct that water to places in the south and in the middle of the state that have been incredibly dry, which has led to the expansion \u2014 the rapid expansion of these fires.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, could you clarify what the military\u2019s role was, where the water came from, and how it got there?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Again, the Army Corps of Engineers has been on the ground in California to respond to the devastation from these wildfires.\u00a0 And I would point out that just days after President Trump visited the devastation from these fires, the water was turned on.\u00a0 That is because of the pressure campaign he put on state and local officials there, who clearly lack all common sense.\u00a0\n\nAnd I will never forget being at that round table with the president last week and hearing the frustration in the voices of Pacific Palisades residents who feel as though their government has just gone insane.\u00a0 Before President Trump showed up on the scene, Karen Bass was telling private property owners that they would have to wait 18 months to access their private property.\n\nSo, this administration, the president and his team that\u2019s on the ground in California \u2014 Ric Grenell, who he has designated to oversee this great crisis \u2014 ha- \u2014 will continue to put pressure on Karen Bass and state and local officials to allow residents to access their properties.\u00a0\n\nThis is a huge part of it.\u00a0 These residents want to take part in their own clearing out of their properties.\u00a0 They should be able to do that.\u00a0 It\u2019s the United States of America.\u00a0 What happened to our freedom?\u00a0 Clearly, it\u2019s gone in California, but not anymore under President Trump.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 April.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, welcome to the briefing room.\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Thank you.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Several questions.\u00a0 One on the pause.\u00a0 Will minority-serving institutions, preferably colleges and universities, have those monies held back temporarily at this moment?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Again, I have not seen the entire list, because this memo was just sent out.\u00a0 So, I will provide you all with updates as we receive them.\u00a0 Okay?\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And secondly \u2014 als- \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, secondly, when it comes to immigration, there is this southern border focus.\u00a0 What happens to those who have overstayed their visas?\u00a0 That is part of the broken immigration system.\u00a0 In 2023, there was a report by the Biden administration, the Homeland Security Department, that said overstays of visas were three times more than usual.\u00a0 Will there be a focus on the overstays for visas as well?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 If an individual is overstaying their visa, they are therefore an illegal immigrant residing in this country, and they are subject to deportation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And also, lastly \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Yes.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, as we\u2019re dealing with anti-DEI, anti-woke efforts, we understand this administration could \u2014 is thinking about celebrating Black History Month.\u00a0 Have you got any word on that?\u00a0 Anything that you can offer to us?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 As far as I know, this White House certainly still intends to celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate American history and the contributions that all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or creed, have made to our great country.\u00a0 And America is back.\n\nChristian Datoc.\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks, Karoline.\u00a0 Just real quick.\u00a0 You mentioned the inflation executive order the president signed, but egg prices have skyrocketed since President Trump took office.\u00a0 So, what specifically is he doing to lower those costs for Americans?\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 Really glad you brought this up, because there is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs.\u00a0 I would like to point out to each and every one of you that, in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office \u2014 or upstairs in the residence sleeping; I\u2019m not so sure \u2014 egg prices increased 65 percent in this country.\u00a0 We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs \u2014 bacon, groceries, gasoline \u2014 have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration.\n\nAs far as the egg shortage, what\u2019s also contributing to that is that the Biden administration and the Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage.\n\nSo, I will leave you with this point.\u00a0 This is an example of why it\u2019s so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump\u2019s nominees, including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, who is already speaking with Kevin Hassett, who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\n\nAs for cots, I laid out \u2014 costs \u2014 I laid out the plethora of ways that President Trump has addressed saving costs for the American people over the past week.\u00a0 He looks forward to continuing to doing that \u2014\n\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Karoline, what \u2014\n\nMS. LEAVITT:\u00a0 \u2014 in the days ahead.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nThank you, guys, so much.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you soon.\n\nEND \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1:52 P.M.
