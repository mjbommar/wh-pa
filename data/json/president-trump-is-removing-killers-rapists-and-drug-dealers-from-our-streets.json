  "summary": "President Donald J. Trump initiated a significant deportation operation targeting criminal illegal immigrants, described as the largest in American history, on March 4, 2025. This operation involves local law enforcement efforts to remove individuals with criminal backgrounds, including charges and convictions for murder, sexual offenses, and involvement in gangs, from U.S. streets. Notably, these actions face resistance from politicians in cities classified as sanctuary cities, where policies may offer protection against deportation.\n\nThe document lists specific cases from various states including, but not limited to, a Portuguese individual convicted of child pornography in Philadelphia and a Guatemalan charged with multiple counts of child rape in Massachusetts. Arrests have occurred in multiple locations such as Philadelphia, Rhode Island, and Texas, among others. Law enforcement officers are positioned as instrumental in apprehending these individuals, furthering the narrative of restoring safety by deportation.\n",
