  "summary": "This document outlines several **Presidential Actions** taken on January 20, 2025, aimed at addressing various national and international issues. The actions include a realignment of the United States Refugee Admissions Program, efforts to enhance American energy production, and clarification on the military's role in safeguarding the country's territorial integrity. Furthermore, there are strategic initiatives such as advocating for an 'America First' trade policy, addressing the backlog of security clearances, and declaring a national emergency at the southern border. \n\nAdditional actions involve ensuring accountability among former government officials for election interference, increasing transparency in federal workforce policy-making positions, and withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization. A significant focus is also placed on imposing restrictions on foreign-controlled applications like TikTok to protect American citizens. These measures reflect a broader shift in policy priorities aimed at strengthening national security and economic interests.",
  "eli5": "The President decided on a bunch of new rules to make the country safer and stronger. This includes changing how the U.S. deals with refugees, making sure our energy comes from America, and making the military protect our borders more. They're also working on important stuff like keeping TikTok safe for us and leaving the group called the World Health Organization.",
