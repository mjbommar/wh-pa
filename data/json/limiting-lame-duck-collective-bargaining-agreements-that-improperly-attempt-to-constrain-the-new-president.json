  "summary": "In a memorandum issued on January 31, 2025, the President directed executive departments and agencies to limit certain collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) made in the last 30 days of a previous administration. This decision arose from concerns that these last-minute agreements were intentionally designed to bind the incoming administration to the prior administration's policies. One cited example involved the Department of Education, which negotiated a CBA just days before the new administration took office, preventing employees from returning to offices from remote work.\n\nThe memorandum establishes policies that disallow new CBAs, substantive changes to existing ones, or extensions of agreements during this 30-day period unless they align with existing contractual provisions. It aims to uphold democratic self-government by ensuring that new administrations can implement their policies without being constrained by the previous Government's final decisions. Furthermore, the memorandum clarifies the standards for CBA durations and emphasizes that agreements inconsistent with the directive should be disapproved by agency heads unless they concern law enforcement officers.\n\nAdditionally, the memorandum clarifies that it should not impair legal authorities granted to departments or agencies, nor should it contravene budgetary regulations set by the Office of Management and Budget. The document also outlines specific legal procedures, including severability clauses should certain provisions be legally challenged, and directs the publication of the memorandum in the Federal Register.",
