  "summary": "On February 28, 2025, widespread support has been expressed for President Donald J. Trump and Vice President JD Vance\u2019s America First policies. They have both emphasized a firm stance against foreign powers taking advantage of the United States, reflecting a more assertive international posture. The article features numerous quotes from government officials, including members of Congress and cabinet secretaries, who have expressed support for the administration's stance.\n\nKey figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and several senators and representatives have praised President Trump and Vice President Vance's efforts to prioritize American interests, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts abroad. The officials criticize what they perceive as previous administrations' excessive spending on foreign entanglements without tangible oversight and emphasize the need for peace through strength.\n\nThe underlying message from these officials is that the current administration is taking a bold and unyielding approach to foreign policy, aiming to ensure American interests are safeguarded and respected on the global stage. There is also a focus on the end of longstanding military engagements and reducing financial contributions abroad, with emphasis on accountability and national interests.",
