In March 2025, President Donald J. Trump initiated a comprehensive series of actions aimed at curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking in the United States. These efforts came after what was portrayed as four years of open border policies under President Biden. Trump's administration reported a significant decrease in illegal border crossings, aggressive increases in ICE arrests, and the dismantling of programs facilitating illegal immigration. Additionally, the administration worked on removing illegal immigrants from the country, collaborating with neighboring countries to enhance border security, and targeting the operations of drug cartels.

Key measures included the suspension of 'catch-and-release' policies and the reinstatement of the 'Remain in Mexico' policy. The administration also terminated the CPB One app, curtailed public benefits for unauthorized immigrants, and pursued new legislative actions like the Laken Riley Act. Furthermore, President Trump declared several drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and deployed drones to dismantle fentanyl labs across borders. These actions were part of a strategic shift to reverse immigration policies and fortify homeland security.
