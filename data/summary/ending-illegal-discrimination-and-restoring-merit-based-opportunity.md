On January 21, 2025, the President issued an executive order aimed at ending practices of discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunities. The order asserts that Federal civil-rights laws protect individuals from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and emphasizes the President's duty to ensure these laws are enforced. It criticizes the use of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI and DEIA) policies in major societal institutions, arguing that such practices violate civil-rights protections and threaten safety by diminishing the value of merit and hard work.

The order mandates all executive departments and agencies to terminate illegal and discriminatory DEI preferences and to enforce existing civil-rights laws. It also revokes certain previous executive orders and memoranda related to diversity and inclusion. The document emphasizes streamlining Federal contracting processes and requires compliance with anti-discrimination laws by Federal contractors and subcontractors. The order seeks to encourage the private sector to cease illegal DEI practices through agency oversight and coordinated efforts, and sets a roadmap for further actions to ensure compliance across diverse sectors.

Additionally, the order includes specific guidelines on how to handle federal procurement, education, and compliance reviews, all in line with protecting civil rights. It excludes preferences for veterans and does not prohibit First Amendment-protected speech, while setting boundaries for how such policies and practices are implemented.
