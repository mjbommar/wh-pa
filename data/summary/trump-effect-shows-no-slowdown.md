In February 2025, President Donald J. Trump, having returned to office, has focused on spearheading initiatives aimed at revitalizing America. Key areas emphasized include border security, deregulation, government efficiency, and fair trade policies. These efforts are touted to foster a 'Golden Age,' with significant actions taken to enhance prosperity and secure the nation. Among these efforts, Trump has introduced tariffs affecting trade, moved towards deregulating businesses for economic growth, and taken measures to enhance government accountability.

Reported impacts of these policies have been felt nationwide. For instance, a major automaker is considering moving production from Mexico due to new tariff negotiations, an Ohio steel plant looks forward to increased jobs and productivity, and there have been significant decreases in migrant crossings at the southwest border. Additionally, investigations have uncovered fiscal discrepancies attributed to the previous administration, and government funding cuts have been implemented in various sectors.
