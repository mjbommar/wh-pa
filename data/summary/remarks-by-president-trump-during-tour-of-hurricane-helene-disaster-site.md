President Trump visited Asheville, North Carolina, on January 24, 2025, to address the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. He expressed his commitment to aiding affected residents who felt neglected by previous administrations. Trump criticized the Biden administrationâ€™s response to the disaster and pledged swift action from the federal government, including the involvement of the Army Corps of Engineers, to rebuild infrastructure such as roads and riverbanks.

During his visit, President Trump met with local residents and heard firsthand accounts of their experiences with the hurricane. Many shared stories of loss and frustration with insurance companies and FEMA. He reassured them of his administration's commitment to providing necessary support and resources. Trump announced plans to streamline bureaucratic processes to expedite recovery efforts and proposed a local approach to disaster management, bypassing FEMA in favor of direct state involvement.

Trump praised the efforts of organizations like Samaritan's Purse for their effective on-the-ground response. He emphasized the importance of local community help over federal assistance, suggesting that states manage their own disaster responses. The President underscored this approach as more effective, highlighting that the federal government would still offer support to ensure rapid recovery.
