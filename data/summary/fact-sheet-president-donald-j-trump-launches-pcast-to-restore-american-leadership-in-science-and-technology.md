On January 23, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced the establishment of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to promote American leadership in critical and emerging technologies. PCAST will comprise up to 24 members, including top scientists and technologists from various sectors. Co-chaired by the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the council will provide strategic recommendations to inform policies based on current scientific and technological insights. This initiative aims to drive innovation, dismantle bureaucratic obstacles, and position the United States as a global leader in scientific and technological progress.

President Trump's initiative emphasizes focusing science and technology policy on delivering measurable results and recognizing merit-based accomplishments. In response to perceived ideological influences that may distort truth and hinder innovation, PCAST seeks to rebuild public trust and reinforce the nation's competitive edge by pooling expertise from academia, industry, and government. The council will prioritize transformative sciences and technological breakthroughs across various industries, ensuring a practical approach aligns with the nation’s pioneering spirit.

Building on the achievements of his first administration, President Trump highlights previous efforts such as the American AI Initiative and the National Quantum Initiative. These initiatives focused on strategic investments and regulatory frameworks to support innovation in fields like autonomous systems, biotechnology, and telecommunications, including advancements in AI research and 5G technologies. The renewed emphasis on innovative science and technology aims to accelerate groundbreaking research and development in these critical areas.
