The **Statement of Administration Policy** supports **H.R. 21** - the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, introduced by **Rep. Ann Wagner** and co-sponsored by 151 others. The statement, dated **January 23, 2025**, is issued from the **Executive Office of the President** and highlights the Administration's strong support of the bill aimed at providing adequate protections for newborns who survive abortion attempts. If enacted, the act would mandate healthcare practitioners to preserve the life and health of such children and ensure they are transported to a hospital.

The bill also entails obligatory reporting by healthcare practitioners or hospital staff of any violations and allows civil legal action by the mothers without criminal penalties. The statement underscores President Trump's 2020 Executive Order affirming the dignity of newborns, asserting that all babies should be treated equally regardless of circumstances. The Administration indicates it would recommend the President sign this bill into law if passed in its current form.
