On March 2, 2025, the President of the United States issued an amendment to a previously established order concerning the southern border. The initial Executive Order 14194, issued on February 1, 2025, was focused on imposing duties to address the situation at the border. This was later modified by Executive Order 14198 on February 3, 2025, which made progress on the matter. The latest amendment further modifies section 2(g) to regulate duty-free *de minimis* treatment, specifically ending it once the Secretary of Commerce confirms systems are ready to manage and collect tariffs.

The amendment aims to refine the handling of tariff duties on imports at the southern border, ensuring that adequate infrastructure is in place for revenue collection. It underscores the Government's intention to maintain a streamlined approach that does not affect existing legal authority or budgetary functions. Additionally, the order clarifies that it does not create any legal rights enforceable against the United States, its agencies, or employees.
