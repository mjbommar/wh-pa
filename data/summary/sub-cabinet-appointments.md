On January 20, 2025, President Trump announced a series of nominations for key sub-cabinet positions within the United States government. These nominations include appointments to roles across various departments such as Defense, Health, Budget, and Justice. For instance, Keith Bass is nominated as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Jayanta Bhattacharya is nominated as the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jayanta Bhattacharya is nominated as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, among others.

These appointments seem to revolve around replacing officials who have resigned from their positions. The announcement covers several high-profile roles, such as Commissioner of Social Security, Deputy Attorney General, and the Administrator of NASA. The nominees hail from different states, bringing a wide range of expertise to the administration. Each nominee awaits confirmation by the Senate to officially assume their roles.
