The document, dated January 20, 2025, outlines a presidential order aimed at ending the perceived weaponization of the federal government by the previous administration. It asserts that the former administration used federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target political opponents, interfere with democratic processes, and suppress free speech. This order sets forth a process to hold accountable those involved in such actions.

To achieve this, the current administration mandates the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to review the past activities of relevant agencies over the last four years. They are tasked with identifying misconduct contrary to the objectives of this order, particularly instances where civil or criminal enforcement actions were politically motivated. Reports are to be prepared with recommendations for remedial measures. This process underscores a commitment to document retention policies and legal compliance.

The order clarifies that it should not negate existing legal authority or budgetary roles and does not create new legal rights for individuals. Any implementation must comply with existing laws and budgetary constraints.
