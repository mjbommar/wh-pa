On February 25, 2025, an announcement was made regarding President Trump's recent Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence (AI), emphasizing the administration’s commitment to maintaining America’s global leadership in AI technology. The order mandates the development of an AI Action Plan aimed at sustaining and enhancing U.S. dominance in AI innovation. The American public is invited to contribute their policy ideas by responding to a Request for Information (RFI) available through the Federal Register’s website until March 15, 2025.

The AI Action Plan seeks to define strategic policy actions to strengthen America’s position as a leader in AI while avoiding excessive regulations that could hinder private sector innovation. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is soliciting input from various parties, including academia, industry, and government groups, to ensure the plan supports human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.
