In February 2025, reports indicate a drastic reduction in illegal immigrant encounters at the U.S. border, particularly in the El Paso sector. This change, attributed to President Donald J. Trump's security measures, has resulted in a significant decrease in the need for migrant shelters across several key locations in the United States, including Texas, Arizona, California, and New York. The decline in illegal crossings has led numerous organizations to either reduce their operations or shut down shelters.

Local shelters that previously provided refuge to thousands of migrants have seen drastically reduced numbers, compelling them to adjust their operations accordingly. In some areas, such as McAllen and Brownsville in Texas and Pima County in Arizona, shelters are closing due to minimal demand. Reports from northern Mexico also corroborate the reduced flow of migrants attempting to cross into the United States, further affirming the impact of the administration's policies on border security.

The overall decrease in illegal immigrant numbers reflects the administrationâ€™s successful efforts to curtail illegal entry into the country. This has left many facilities, which used to be active in accommodating immigrants, devoid of occupants, leading to closures and layoffs of staff. This state of affairs highlights the significant shifts in immigration patterns and policy effects post-2023 under Trump's presidency.
