**President Donald J. Trump signed a new Executive Order to combat anti-Semitism in the United States on January 30, 2025.** This order builds on the previous Executive Order 13899 and aims to counter the rise in anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses and in various public spaces, which have reportedly increased since October 7, 2023. It mandates all federal departments and agency leaders to assess and report all available legal actions for addressing anti-Semitism within 60 days. Moreover, the Department of Justice is tasked with taking immediate actions to enforce law and order against pro-Hamas activities.

**The order underscores the protection of civil rights for Jewish Americans and promises to enforce laws against anti-Semitic crimes, including deporting non-citizens involved in related activities.** Following the terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, 2023, and subsequent demonstrations on American campuses, President Trump has declared a commitment to aggressively prosecute related criminal activities and cancel visas of pro-Hamas student sympathizers. Additionally, the fact sheet highlights President Trump's past commitments to Israel, such as moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and establishing the Abraham Accords, while focusing on future promises to protect Jewish citizens' rights.
