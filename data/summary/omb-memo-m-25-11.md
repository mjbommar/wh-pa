On January 21, 2025, a memorandum was issued to the heads of departments and agencies, authored by Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Kevin Hassett, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council. The purpose of the memorandum is to provide guidance on implementing Section 7 of the Executive Order *Unleashing American Energy*. This section mandates an immediate pause on the disbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which are involved in programs that conflict with the policies described in Section 2 of the Order.

The memorandum clarifies that the pause in funds primarily affects projects associated with the "Green New Deal," interpreting the order as consistent due to its heading "Terminating the Green New Deal". The agency heads are instructed to consult with the Office of Management and Budget before resuming the disbursement of funds, ensuring alignment with the policies set forth in the Executive Order. The guidance underscores a shift in energy policy as directed by the Executive Order.
