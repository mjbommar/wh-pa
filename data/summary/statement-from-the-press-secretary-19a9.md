The White House released a statement from the Press Secretary on February 28, 2025, announcing the extradition of 29 members of Mexican cartels to the United States. This operation was directed by President Trump and executed by the Department of Justice and the Department of State, under the leadership of Attorney General Bondi and Secretary of State Rubio. Included among these individuals is Rafael Caro Quintero, a notorious cartel boss linked to the torture and murder of DEA Agent Kiki Camerena in 1985.

The Trump Administration is labeling these cartel members as terrorists to underscore the severity of their criminal activities and is committed to securing justice for their offenses. The move marks a significant action against international crime syndicates, contrasting the previous administrationâ€™s approach, which reportedly did not take similar measures.
