On January 20, 2025, the White House website documented a series of actions and statements from President Trump. These include several Presidential Actions focused on reversing prior executive orders and establishing new directives aimed at ending what is perceived as the federal government's weaponization and restoring freedom of speech. A significant remark noted is the Inaugural Address, marking the start of President Trump's term. Other actions include announcements of key appointments to the cabinet and sub-cabinet positions. Each announcement is accompanied by its respective directive and timing on the White House official website.

These updates are part of a broader policy strategy that President Trump calls 'America First Priorities.' The changes emphasize redesigning the federal governance framework to align with these priorities, which includes putting a stop to alleged federal censorship and adjusting administrative roles to align with the new administrative goals. The Presidential Actions were published alongside briefings outlining their expected impacts and objectives for the upcoming term.
