On February 25, 2025, an order was issued by the President of the United States to address vulnerabilities in the U.S. copper supply chain, which are deemed a threat to national security. The action leverages the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, specifically section 232, to investigate the impact of copper imports on national security. The directive points to the critical role of copper in defense, technology, and infrastructure, coupled with significant reliance on foreign imports.

The order mandates the Secretary of Commerce to assess the national security implications of various forms of copper imports, considering factors like domestic production capacity, foreign supply chain dependency, and trade policies. A key concern is the U.S.'s reliance on a limited number of foreign suppliers and potential market manipulations. The Secretary of Commerce is required to consult with other government departments and recommend policy actions, such as tariffs or incentives, within 270 days to mitigate these risks.
