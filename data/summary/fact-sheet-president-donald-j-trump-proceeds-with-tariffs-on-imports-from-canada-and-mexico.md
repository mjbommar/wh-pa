President Donald J. Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on March 3, 2025, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This action is part of an effort to combat the national security threat posed by drug trafficking, particularly involving fentanyl. Trump's administration argues that both Canada and Mexico have failed to prevent drug trafficking cartels from operating within their borders, resulting in a public health crisis in the United States.

The decision to enforce tariffs is seen as a measure to hold these countries accountable and curb the influx of drugs and illegal immigration. The administration claims that the Biden administration's border policies led to a severe border crisis and increased illegal entries at both northern and southern borders. Trump's approach builds on his earlier policies focused on national security and trade, emphasizing tariffs as a tool to press foreign governments to take action against drug cartels.

Additionally, the statement highlights the dramatic impact of fentanyl on American public health, with fentanyl overdoses leading to more deaths than those seen in the Vietnam War. The administration's strategy is framed as fulfilling Trump's promise to secure American borders and reduce illegal drugs by leveraging economic sanctions through trade policies.
