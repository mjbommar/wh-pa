On January 31, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued by the new administration to address the practice of outgoing administrations finalizing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) just before leaving office. This memorandum is directed at the heads of executive departments and agencies, with the aim of preventing such agreements from restricting the new President's ability to implement their policies. The memorandum specifically prohibits the execution of CBAs during the last 30 days of a Presidential term if they create new obligations, change existing agreements significantly, or extend their terms.

The memorandum outlines that any agreement made in contravention of these standards should not be approved by agency heads. It also clarifies that these rules will not apply to CBAs primarily covering law enforcement officers. Additionally, the document specifies that it should not impinge on lawful authorities or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget, and that it must comply with applicable law and appropriations. Legal challenges may sever certain provisions, and this memorandum does not establish enforceable rights for third parties.
