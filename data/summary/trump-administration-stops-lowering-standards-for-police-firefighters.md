The Trump Administration has officially ended initiatives that lower standards in hiring for police and firefighter positions, which were implemented under a previous government focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. On February 27, 2025, President Trump confirmed the commitment to prioritize merit-based hiring practices across the board. The decision aligns with an overall policy to emphasize qualifications over racial or diversity considerations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi recently announced that the Department of Justice has dismissed a series of lawsuits initiated during the Biden Administration. These lawsuits involved claims of discrimination against various city and state departments, which had implemented race-neutral hiring practices such as aptitude tests, physical exams, and credit checks. Some notable cases dismissed include those against the City of Durham, Maryland State Police, Cobb County, and the City of South Bend, due to the perceived impact on public safety standards.

This move is intended to ensure that only the most capable individuals, regardless of background, are hired to safeguard public safety, adhering strictly to merit-based evaluations in these crucial public service roles.
