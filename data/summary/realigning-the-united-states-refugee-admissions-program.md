On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to realign the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The order temporarily suspends the admission of refugees, citing concerns about the country's ability to appropriately assimilate large numbers of migrants without compromising resources, safety, and security for American citizens. This suspension will remain until it is determined that refugee admissions align with national interests.

The executive order outlines several key policies, prioritizing national security and the strategic assimilation of refugees. It instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on refugee applications and to review existing laws regarding state and local jurisdictions' involvement in refugee placement. Exceptions to the suspension may be made on a case-by-case basis if considered in the national interest.

The order revokes a previous executive order focused on enhancing refugee resettlement programs, reflecting a shift in policy. Regular reports will be submitted to review the suspension's necessity, and the suspension will be lifted if deemed beneficial to the United States. The executive order includes provisions for its implementation and ensures it does not impair existing law or create enforceable rights.
