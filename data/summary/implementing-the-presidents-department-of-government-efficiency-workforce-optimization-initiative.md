The document is a Presidential Action dated February 11, 2025, detailing an initiative called the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) aimed at reforming the federal workforce to enhance efficiency and productivity. The order establishes a hiring freeze ratio, mandates agency heads to create hiring plans with their respective DOGE Team Leads, and outlines criteria for reducing the workforce through large-scale reductions in force (RIFs). The document also specifies rulemaking by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to introduce additional suitability criteria for federal employment and calls for agency restructuring plans to be submitted within 30 days.

The initiative permits exemptions for positions related to national security, public safety, and law enforcement. The USDS Administrator is tasked with reporting to the President within 240 days on the implementation of the order. The document provides a framework for implementing these changes while ensuring compliance with existing laws and available appropriations. Notably, exclusions from the order include military personnel, and the document underscores that it is not intended to create enforceable rights for any party.

Throughout the document, several terms and positions are defined, such as 'Agency,' 'Agency Head,' 'DOGE Team Lead,' and 'Temporary Employee,' offering a systematic approach to the new directives. The overall intention is to streamline the federal workforce, reduce unnecessary positions, and ensure alignment with broader government efficiency goals.
