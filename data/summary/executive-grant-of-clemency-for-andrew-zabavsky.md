On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Grant of Clemency to Andrew Zabavsky. Zabavsky had been convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violating sections 371 and 1512 of title 18 of the United States Code. These convictions resulted in a sentence of 48 months of imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently, along with three years of supervised release and a special assessment of $200.

By utilizing his powers under Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution, President Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Zabavsky. This action was formalized with instructions for the Pardon Attorney to sign the grant of clemency, acting as the President's representative. The pardon document was executed in Washington, D.C., with the Department of Justice's seal and was intended to count as an official act of the President.
