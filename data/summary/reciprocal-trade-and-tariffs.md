The memorandum, dated February 13, 2025, addresses the issue of reciprocal trade and tariffs, directed by the President to various key economic officers, including the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce among others. The document emphasizes the need to balance the trade deficit and improve the economic standing of the United States by adjusting the current trade policies. It introduces the 'Fair and Reciprocal Plan,' aiming to ensure that trade arrangements with international partners are equitable and fair by examining tariff and non-tariff barriers. 

The document notes that the U.S. currently has a large trade deficit and one of the most open economies with low tariffs compared to other major economies. The President's plan entails implementing reciprocal tariffs and addressing unfair and unbalanced trading practices to strengthen the U.S.' competitiveness globally. It calls for comprehensive evaluations and actions led by the relevant departments to remedy non-reciprocal trade practices detrimental to the American economy, seeking to enhance fairness on an international scale.
