On January 20, 2025, a Presidential Executive Order was issued, aiming to re-establish biological definitions of sex and gender within the federal government. It mandates that the U.S. Executive Branch recognizes and enforces legal distinctions between male and female, based on immutable biological facts rather than gender identity. This order argues that recent policies and ideologies that allow individuals to self-identify gender have compromised womenâ€™s rights, particularly in areas like single-sex spaces and legal protections.

The order provides specific definitions for sex, male, and female and outlines steps for federal agencies to align with these definitions. It rescinds policies and guidance documents from the previous administration that were seen as promoting 'gender ideology.' The administration emphasizes using biological definitions for official documents, restructuring access to federal accommodations, and ensuring federal funds are not used to support gender ideology.

Key administrative actions include revising federal document language, protecting single-sex spaces, and assessing federal funding to prevent support of policies based on gender identity. The order also mandates federal agencies to report on implementing these changes within 120 days, intending to secure legal clarity and maintain constitutional rights regarding sex-based protections.
