On February 25, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to investigate the impact of copper imports on the national security and economic stability of the United States. The Executive Order instructs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This investigation aims to evaluate the risks connected to America's growing dependence on imported copper and determine whether trade remedies are required to protect the domestic copper industry.

President Trump highlights the critical role that copper plays in national defense, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, while expressing concern over the United States' declining smelting and refining capabilities. With America importing 45% of its copper needs as of 2024, the investigation will explore vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain due to foreign overcapacity and potential export restrictions. This move is part of a broader effort by the administration to bolster American industry by revisiting trade policies and imposing tariffs to address international trade imbalances.
