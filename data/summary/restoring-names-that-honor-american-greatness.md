The President of the United States issued an order on January 20, 2025, aimed at restoring historical names that honor American contributions and national heritage. The order focuses on updating national landmarks' names to reflect significant American historical figures and events. A particular change cited is restoring the name 'Mount McKinley' for North America's highest peak, previously changed to 'Denali' in 2015. The order also addresses renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' aiming to highlight its value to the U.S. economy and heritage.

To implement these directives, the order tasks the Secretary of the Interior with updating the Geographic Names Information System and working with relevant parties, including state and local organizations, to reflect these changes officially. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names will also undergo changes, with agency heads reviewing and possibly replacing current appointees to align with the new policy priorities. This order also includes provisions for further actions to recognize more American patriots, especially in anticipation of the semiquincentennial celebration of the United States.
