President Donald J. Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum dated January 22, 2025, which directs the cessation of a hiring policy implemented during the Biden Administration that prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The memorandum mandates a return to merit-based hiring, emphasizing safety and efficiency as the primary criteria for employment. This action aims to ensure that FAA employees are fully capable and competent, to protect the safety of air travel passengers. The memorandum also requires a review of current FAA personnel in critical positions to ensure their continued capability in meeting safety requirements.

The decision to revoke DEI policies highlights concerns about previous FAA hiring practices that reportedly gave preference to candidates with severe intellectual disabilities and psychiatric issues under DEI initiatives. The memorandum refers to a significant FAA system outage on January 11, 2023, as a failure of competence during a critical time, underscoring the need for skilled personnel. This action follows President Trump's broader initiative, indicated in an Executive Order dated January 20, 2025, to eliminate government programs he considers discriminatory or wasteful, reaffirming his administration's commitment to a merit-based, colorblind society.
