On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aiming to protect United States borders by preventing the entry of illegal aliens perceived as an invasion through the southern border. This action is rooted in the federal government's constitutional obligation under Article IV, Section 4 to protect states from invasion. The Executive Order authorizes federal departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, and State, to take necessary actions in repelling and deporting these aliens. Concurrently, it limits their ability to access legal immigration remedies like asylum.

The order underscores President Trump’s 2024 campaign vow to fortify national borders, citing that illegal immigration significantly impacts American lives by affecting jobs, taxpayer resources, and public safety. The directive asserts the President's rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act and Article II of the Constitution to enforce these immigration measures and challenges the previous administration’s perceived inadequacies in addressing illegal immigration.
