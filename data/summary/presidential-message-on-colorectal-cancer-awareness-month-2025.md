During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in March 2025, the President and First Lady extend their support to those affected by colorectal cancer, highlighting its significant impact as a leading cause of cancer deaths in America. The President emphasizes the Administration's commitment to combating chronic diseases and advancing health across the nation. Statistical data shows 150,000 Americans are diagnosed annually, with 50,000 succumbing to the disease, particularly affecting those aged 18 to 49.

The President notes advancements in medical technology since 1975 have drastically improved survival rates, with nearly a million lives saved from colorectal cancer due to improved screening and treatment methods. The United States leads in medical innovations, illustrated by the FDA's recent approval of a blood test for average-risk colon cancer, which joins existing screening options like colonoscopies. The Administration pledges ongoing innovation to lower cancer rates and work toward a future free from the disease.
