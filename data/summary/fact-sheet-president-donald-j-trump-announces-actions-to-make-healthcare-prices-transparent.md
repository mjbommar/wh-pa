On February 25, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to enhance healthcare price transparency, aimed at empowering patients by ensuring they have access to clear and actionable pricing information. This executive order mandates the Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to implement these regulations promptly and enforce compliance. The goal is to make hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices and promote comparability, including for prescription drugs.

The initiative seeks to reduce healthcare costs for American families by eliminating hidden prices that benefit large corporate entities. With price transparency, patients and employers can identify more affordable healthcare options, potentially saving billions. In 2023, the Biden Administration faced legal challenges for not meeting drug price transparency requirements, and the Trump Administration intends to hold entities accountable.

President Trump reiterates his commitment to prioritizing patient needs by ensuring that healthcare pricing is accessible, allowing patients to make informed decisions about their care. The initiative builds on his previous actions, emphasizing the need for a healthcare system that offers high-quality care at competitive prices, benefiting consumers financially and providing access to the best medical talent.
