The webpage from the White House contains a list of various presidential actions that were taken on January 20, 2025. These actions are diverse and aim to address different governmental and societal issues. They include reforming the federal hiring process to restore merit-based government service, ending specific diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and protecting women's rights by reinforcing biological truths within the federal government.

Other significant actions cover the establishment of a new Department of Government Efficiency, an America First directive for the Secretary of State, measures against foreign terrorist threats, and the promotion of resource development in Alaska. Additionally, there are directives to protect the American populace from invasions and an analysis of a global tax deal led by the OECD, as well as the organization of the National Security Council.

Each action seeks to strengthen national security, optimize government processes, and refocus administrative efforts on prioritizing the U.S. global strategy and internal resource management. The document primarily serves as a news section of the White House website where these detailed directives are accessible to the public.
