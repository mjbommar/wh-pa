On February 12, 2025, an American citizen previously held hostage in Belarus was freed thanks to efforts led by President Donald J. Trump and his administration. This release marks the second hostage returned safely to the United States in the last 24 hours and the eleventh since President Trump assumed office. The administration's accomplishments in securing the freedom of U.S. hostages showcase the intensified U.S. resolve under President Trump's leadership. 

Key figures in the administration, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, praised the president's leadership and deal-making capabilities. They emphasized the administration's ongoing commitment to securing the release of Americans held abroad. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler noted the president's prioritization of these efforts as a major factor in the success of these operations. The sentiment was echoed by other officials, reflecting broad support for the president's approach to international diplomacy and hostage negotiations.
