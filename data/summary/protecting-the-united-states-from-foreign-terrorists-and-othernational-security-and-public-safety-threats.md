On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued with the aim of bolstering U.S. national security by enhancing the vetting and screening procedures for foreign nationals entering the United States. The order leveraged the authority granted to the President by the Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and U.S. Code. The directive instructs key government officials, including the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence, to utilize maximum resources for vetting individuals seeking entry to the U.S.

The order specifies the need to identify and mitigate threats from countries with inadequate screening processes and calls for potential suspension of nationals from such countries. It also outlines steps to improve existing regulations and policies to ensure national safety. Enhanced measures should prevent admission of refugees or stateless individuals without stringent verification and protect against foreign influences undermining U.S. constitutional rights.

Within 30 to 60 days of the order, various secretaries and agencies are required to submit reports and recommendations on necessary actions and resource allocations. The order stresses ensuring adherence to existing laws and appropriation limits, while also maintaining the objective of securing the nation from foreign threats without creating enforceable legal rights for individuals.
