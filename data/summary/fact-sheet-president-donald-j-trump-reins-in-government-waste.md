On February 26, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at increasing efficiency within the U.S. government by reducing waste in government contracts and grants. This order initiates the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost efficiency initiative, which mandates federal agencies to review all contracts and grants to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. It also requires agencies to justify government payments and travel expenses, making these details publicly accessible when feasible. The order enlists agency heads to collaborate with DOGE leads to eliminate unnecessary contracts and oversees the improvement of real property management by instructing the General Services Administration (GSA) to propose a plan for disposing of unneeded government properties.

The initiative seeks to address weaknesses in the existing system that purportedly lacks safeguards to protect taxpayer funds and does not adequately emphasize merit among contractors and grant recipients. This move is a continuation of President Trump's earlier efforts, from his first term, to enhance governmental efficiency through regulatory reforms and aims to build on previous successes in economic growth. In contrast, the previous administration focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, which the Executive Order suggests detracted from merit-based and efficient practices.
