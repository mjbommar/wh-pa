President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 10, 2025, aimed at revising enforcement guidelines for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 to enhance American competitiveness and security. The order instructs the Attorney General to halt current FCPA actions until new guidelines are issued to promote fair competition and effective law enforcement. All ongoing and future FCPA-related actions will require her approval.

The initiative is driven by concerns that excessive FCPA enforcement hinders U.S. companies by preventing them from using business practices common among international competitors, thereby affecting their global competitiveness. The administration argues that strategic commercial advantages in resources and assets are vital for national security and that current FCPA enforcement overextends U.S. authority, impacting the economy and infringing on presidential powers.

This action is part of President Trump's broader strategy to prioritize American economic interests. He has signed executive actions to boost economic competitiveness, such as strengthening leadership in artificial intelligence, renegotiating trade deals, and reducing burdensome regulations. These measures are intended to ensure that U.S. businesses can effectively compete on the global stage, supporting American workers and families.
