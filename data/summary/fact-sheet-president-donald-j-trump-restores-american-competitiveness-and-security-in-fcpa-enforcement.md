President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 10, 2025, aimed at revising the enforcement guidelines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977. The order requires the Attorney General to halt current FCPA actions until new enforcement guidelines that promote American competitiveness are established. This move is said to align with the administration's aim to eliminate barriers that affect U.S. companies' ability to compete globally. Past and future FCPA cases will be reviewed under the new guidelines and approved by the Attorney General.

The administration argues that overly strict enforcement of the FCPA has disadvantaged American companies, especially in strategic sectors like critical minerals and infrastructure, which are vital for national security. The document refers to the necessity of balancing legal enforcement with the Presidentâ€™s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs, which has apparently been hampered by overextended FCPA actions. Historically, FCPA enforcement has been costly, with numerous cases and investigations in past years, emphasizing the need for updated policies.

President Trump's actions are part of a broader strategy to reinforce American economic primacy and security. Other initiatives mentioned include enhancing leadership in artificial intelligence, implementing a 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, and renegotiating key trade agreements like the USMCA. Trump emphasizes that U.S. policies should support American workers and businesses to ensure fair competition globally.
