On January 24, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued to the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The memorandum revokes a previous memorandum from January 28, 2021, and reinstates the Mexico City Policy, originally issued on January 23, 2017. This policy pertains to U.S. global health assistance and seeks to regulate the use of funds by ensuring that they do not support organizations that engage in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.

The Secretary of State, in collaboration with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is directed to develop a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated memorandum across all global health aid provisions from U.S. departments or agencies. Additionally, the Secretary of State is tasked with ensuring that U.S. taxpayer funds do not contribute to the management of programs that involve coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its representatives.

The document also authorizes the Secretary of State to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. This action reflects a shift in the administration's policy regarding international health assistance, emphasizing the prevention of U.S. funds being used for organizations involved in certain reproductive health practices.
