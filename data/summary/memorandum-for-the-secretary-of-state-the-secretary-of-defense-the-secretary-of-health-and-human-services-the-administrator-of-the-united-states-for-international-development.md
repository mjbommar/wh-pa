On January 24, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued addressing the Mexico City Policy. This memorandum revokes an earlier directive from January 28, 2021, and reinstates a previous policy from January 23, 2017. The main goal of this action is to ensure that U.S. government funding does not support organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. 

The Secretary of State, along with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is instructed to create and implement a plan to apply the guidelines of this reinstated policy across all global health assistance provided by U.S. departments and agencies. The memorandum emphasizes that this directive does not create any legal rights enforceable against the U.S. government. Finally, it authorizes the Secretary of State to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register, ensuring its provisions are widely disseminated and understood.
