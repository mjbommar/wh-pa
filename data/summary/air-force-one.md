Air Force One is the official aircraft used by the President of the United States, enabling rapid travel to any location worldwide on short notice. The designation 'Air Force One' applies to any Air Force plane carrying the President, but it primarily refers to two distinctively modified Boeing 747-200B series aircraft. These aircraft, with tail codes 28000 and 29000 and designated as VC-25A by the Air Force, are equipped with advanced security and communications technologies, making them mobile command centers.

The planes have the ability to refuel midair, granting them virtually unlimited range. Inside, there is ample space spread over three levels, featuring a presidential suite, conference room, and a medical facility that can function as an operating room. The aircraft also possesses two kitchens capable of preparing meals for up to 100 people. The Presidential Airlift Group handles the operation and maintenance of these planes, a unit founded in 1944 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Throughout history, Air Force One has been an iconic symbol of the presidency. The development of this fleet reflects technological advances in aviation and the increasing mobility demands on the President. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy flew in the first jet specifically built for the President's use, and the current fleet began service in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush's administration.
