The text is an executive order issued on January 20, 2025, by the President of the United States, addressing the issues of election interference and the improper disclosure of sensitive governmental information. It highlights an incident where 51 former intelligence officials, in coordination with the Biden campaign, issued a misleading letter during the 2020 Presidential campaign. This letter, purportedly vetted by the CIA Prepublication Classification Review Board, was intended to discredit a news story about President Bidenâ€™s son, falsely suggesting a Russian disinformation angle.

The executive order aims to revoke security clearances of officials involved in this incident and emphasizes the need to keep the Intelligence Community politically neutral and prevent the use of classified information for personal gain. It directs the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA to revoke the security clearances of specified individuals, including former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton. Additionally, the order requires a report detailing any inappropriate activities relating to the incident and recommendations to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
