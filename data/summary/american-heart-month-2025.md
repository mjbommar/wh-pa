In a proclamation dated February 3, 2025, President Donald J. Trump declared February 2025 as American Heart Month. The objective of this declaration is to raise awareness about heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States, and to encourage Americans to adopt healthier lifestyles to prevent this condition. President Trump emphasized the importance of addressing risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle habits like smoking and excessive alcohol use to reduce the incidence of heart disease.

Furthermore, the proclamation calls for participation in National Wear Red Day on February 7, 2025, and invites governors, officials, and the public to join efforts to combat heart disease. The initiative acknowledges the progress made in cardiovascular health due to medical advancements, while also highlighting the need for ongoing efforts, including investigating the root causes of various health issues. This declaration aligns with Congressâ€™s long-standing tradition since 1963, as per 36 U.S.C. 101, to observe February as American Heart Month.
