On March 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order designating English as the official language of the United States. This order replaces a previous mandate from the Clinton administration that required federal agencies and funding recipients to offer extensive language support to non-English speakers. Although agencies can still provide services in other languages, they are encouraged to promote English as a national language to provide more opportunities for new Americans.

The move to designate English as the official language is aimed at unifying the American people. Historically, foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution have been written in English. The order aims to strengthen societal unity by establishing a common national language that facilitates civic engagement and government efficiency. The United States is unique in not having an official language, despite over 350 languages being spoken nationwide.

This decision aligns with President Trump's long-standing belief that English should be the official language to foster national cohesion and cultural enrichment. The Executive Order is seen as fulfilling a promise by affirming that a shared language helps newcomers assimilate into American traditions and communities while celebrating multilingual individuals who have learned and maintained English.
