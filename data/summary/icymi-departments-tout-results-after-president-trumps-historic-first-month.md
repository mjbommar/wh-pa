In February 2025, the Trump Administration marked President Donald J. Trump's return to office with a focus on several key areas, highlighting one month of accomplishments. The departments celebrated this milestone by emphasizing their contributions to implementing the President's agenda. Key initiatives included the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to reinforce security and law enforcement, the Interior Department's actions to unleash American energy, and the Education Department's advancements in educational choice and combating ideologies.

Moreover, the Department of Housing and Urban Development focused on ensuring access to affordable housing, while the State Department emphasized an America First foreign policy. Other departments, such as Transportation, aimed to reduce regulatory burdens, and Defense sought to strengthen military effectiveness and accountability. Health and Human Services turned toward more traditional health practices, moving away from the prior administration's policies.
