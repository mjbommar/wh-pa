On January 28, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum in relation to a set of Executive Orders from President Trump. The guidance requests federal agencies to temporarily pause funding for grant, loan, or financial assistance programs that are implicated by these Executive Orders. This pause is not applicable to programs that are directly beneficial to individuals or not associated with the Presidentâ€™s directives. Some Executive Orders involved include reshaping foreign aid, prioritizing American energy, and ending government programs related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

The document clarifies that this pause is not a blanket freeze on federal assistance. It specifically excludes direct benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP, among others. Such programs are essential to citizens and are exempt from this temporary halt. The memorandum outlines a procedure whereby agencies collaborate with the OMB to assess and quickly resolve potential conflicts with the Executive Orders. This ensures continuity of programs not directly affected by the Orders and avoids any delay in lawful payments.

The pause is described as a tool to align federal spending with the new administration's policies, rather than an impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. The guidance aims to ensure tax dollars are managed in alignment with the new policy direction and law. Such measures have been utilized by past administrations during transitions in presidential policies.
