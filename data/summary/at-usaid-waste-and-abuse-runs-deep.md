The article discusses longstanding concerns regarding waste and abuse within the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It highlights specific instances where money has been allocated to projects deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, such as DEI initiatives in Serbia, arts and culture projects in Ireland, Colombia, and Peru, and various forms of activism in Guatemala. Additionally, significant funds have been used to support questionable international associations and controversial agricultural practices in Afghanistan, ultimately benefiting harmful organizations like the Taliban. 

These examples are presented as evidence of systemic financial mismanagement and lack of oversight at USAID. The article asserts that this pattern of wastefulness has persisted for decades and calls for an immediate end to these practices under President Trump's administration. The article suggests that existing oversight mechanisms have failed to prevent misuse of funds, leading to a call for stricter control and accountability measures within USAID.
