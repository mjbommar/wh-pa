On January 29, 2025, a memorandum was issued by the President directing the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to its full capacity. The expansion is aimed at increasing detention space for high-priority criminal aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. This decision is part of broader efforts to address immigration enforcement needs as identified by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. 

The memorandum emphasizes the necessity of this action in order to halt border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels, and restore national sovereignty. It makes clear that the directive does not create any legal rights or benefits enforceable by any parties against the United States or its entities.
