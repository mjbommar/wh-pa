On January 30, 2025, a memorandum was issued by the President to the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following a tragic collision involving a commercial aircraft and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This memorandum orders an immediate assessment of aviation safety, aimed at addressing safety concerns by reviewing hiring decisions and changes to safety protocols made during the previous administration. The memorandum highlights concerns about the minimization of merit and competence in the FAA, attributed to hiring practices during the Obama and Biden administrations, including directives that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The President criticized these practices as compromising aviation safety and stressed the importance of returning to a merit-based approach. An emphasis is placed on evaluating any deterioration in standards under the Biden administration and taking corrective actions to enhance safety measures. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the FAA are tasked with correcting these trends and ensuring that qualified individuals fill key positions as part of enhancing aviation safety.
