On January 30, 2025, a memorandum was issued following a tragic collision between a commercial aircraft and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The President addressed this incident by attributing issues within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to past administrations. He criticized hiring practices influenced by the Obama and Biden Administrations that emphasized diversity over merit, alleging these policies compromised safety and competence.

The President instructed the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator to review hiring decisions and safety protocol changes from the previous four years. This directive aims to identify and rectify any reductions in hiring and safety standards, as part of a broader initiative to uphold aviation safety in line with a previous Presidential Memorandum. The ultimate goal is to instill a commitment to safety and ensure peace of mind for all air travelers.
