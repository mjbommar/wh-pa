On February 19, 2025, Donald J. Trump, the President of the United States, issued a proclamation commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima, a pivotal campaign during World War II. The battle began on February 19, 1945, when U.S. Marines landed on Iwo Jima and faced fierce resistance from the Japanese forces. The conflict lasted for 36 days, resulting in nearly 7,000 American deaths and 20,000 injuries, but ultimately led to a significant victory in the Pacific Theater.

The proclamation highlights the bravery and sacrifices of the 70,000 men involved, noting the momentous raising of the U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi by six Marines as a symbol of American grit and courage. President Trump also emphasized the strategic impact of the battle and the lasting alliance between the United States and Japan as a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific region. He urges all Americans to honor the valor of the Greatest Generation and remain committed to building a nation worthy of their sacrifices.
