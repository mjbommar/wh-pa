In February 2025, it was reported that illegal border crossings at the southern US border significantly decreased in January 2025. This decline came shortly after President Donald J. Trump returned to office and initiated his policies aimed at curbing illegal immigration. According to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, there was a 36% reduction in apprehensions from the previous month, totaling 61,465 apprehensions, with 29,116 arrests occurring directly along the border.

In the period following Trump's inauguration on January 20th, apprehensions further decreased, with an 85% drop in border apprehensions compared to the previous year and a 93% decrease at ports of entry. This change is attributed to Trump's stringent immigration policies which contrasted with the previous administration's approach that had allegedly increased illegal crossings. These measures have reportedly led to the lowest levels of illegal crossings since May 2020, with deportations actively occurring as part of the new immigration enforcement strategy.
