### Summary

On March 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an order to honor Jocelyn Nungaray, a twelve-year-old girl who was murdered in Houston, Texas. The two individuals charged with her murder were illegal immigrants allegedly affiliated with a Venezuelan gang, highlighting issues attributed to the immigration policies of the previous administration. This order aims to rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge as the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge in her memory.

The change in designation of the wildlife refuge is instructed to be carried out by the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days, ensuring that all federal references update this change. The document specifies that the order should not hinder existing executive authorities or budgetary functions and does not create any legal rights enforceable against the United States.
