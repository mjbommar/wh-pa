On February 10, 2025, the President issued an Executive Order to pause enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. The President argues that current enforcement of the FCPA has been too broad, impeding U.S. foreign policy objectives by affecting Americaâ€™s economic competitiveness and national security. During this pause, the Attorney General is tasked with reviewing existing FCPA guidelines and enforcement actions to ensure they align with the President's foreign policy prerogatives and the strategic economic interests of the United States.

The Attorney General must also decide whether to continue, adjust, or cease ongoing and future FCPA investigations, with a possibility of extending this review period by another 180 days if needed. Any new or continued investigations must receive approval from the Attorney General. The order emphasizes that if any part of this order is invalidated, the remaining provisions still stand, and it clarifies that the order does not create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.
