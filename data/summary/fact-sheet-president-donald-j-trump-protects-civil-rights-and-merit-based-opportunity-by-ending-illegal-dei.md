On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order that aims to safeguard civil rights and promote merit-based opportunities by abolishing DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) practices in federal contracting and employment. The order intends to ensure that federal hiring and promotions are based on individual performance, skills, and hard work rather than DEI criteria. Furthermore, it seeks to simplify the federal contracting process and mandates that contractors uphold non-discrimination principles.

The Executive Order directs all federal departments and agencies to actively prevent DEI-related discrimination within the private sector, including thorough investigations into civil compliance. It also instructs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education to provide guidance in line with the Supreme Court's decision in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*. The administration asserts that this order will foster a colorblind and competence-based professional environment, distancing itself from the policies established by the previous administration.

The order reflects Trump's fulfillment of his pledge to dismantle DEI programs and uphold equal opportunity by emphasizing individual merit, hard work, and competence. Critics of current DEI initiatives argue these programs foster division and bias rather than reducing discrimination. The order calls for a return to treating employees based solely on their abilities and achievements.
