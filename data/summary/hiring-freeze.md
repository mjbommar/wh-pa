On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued a memorandum imposing a hiring freeze on Federal civilian employees across the executive branch. This measure, which targets vacant positions existing at that noon and disallows the creation of new positions, aims to manage the size of the Federal Government's workforce. It is notable that the freeze does not affect military personnel or positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, and public safety, ensuring that essential services such as Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits remain unaffected.

The memorandum mandates the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the United States Digital Service (USDS), to devise a plan within 90 days to reduce the Federal workforce through improved efficiencies and attrition. The memorandum's terms expire upon the OMB plan's issuance but persist for the IRS until such a time the Secretary of the Treasury and other relevant authorities decide otherwise. The document outlines specific exemptions, forbidding contracting out to bypass its intent, and details permissible hiring such as Presidential appointments, non-career Senior Executive Service positions, and others as allowed by law.
