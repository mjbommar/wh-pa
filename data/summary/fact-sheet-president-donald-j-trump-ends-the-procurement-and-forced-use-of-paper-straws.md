**President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 10, 2025, directing the end of procurement and use of paper straws by the federal government.** The order mandates the development of a National Strategy within 45 days to eliminate the use of paper straws across the nation. The aim is to stop what is viewed as the coerced usage of nonfunctional paper alternatives to plastic straws.

The rationale behind this directive includes concerns over health risks posed by chemicals in paper straws, such as PFAS, which can dissolve into drinks, as well as economic inefficiencies and environmental concerns. The executive order aligns with President Trump's broader environmental policy, emphasizing economic growth and clean air and water, and critiques prior administration efforts as wasteful. Additional comments in the fact sheet highlight other environmental policies such as forest management, opposition to windmill expansion for its potential harm to wildlife, and support for American energy independence through fossil fuels.
