**President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 10, 2025, to end the procurement and mandatory use of paper straws within Federal buildings.** The order directs the Federal government to cease purchasing paper straws and establishes a 45-day timeline to develop a National Strategy to phase out paper straws nationwide. The decision is based on concerns over the inefficacy and potential health risks of paper straws, as well as their environmental impact. Paper straws have been criticized for containing PFAS, known as “forever chemicals,” which are highly soluble in water and may migrate into beverages.

**The document argues for a return to plastic straws citing cost-effectiveness and lesser environmental impact.** Trump’s administration criticizes previous bans on plastic straws as being driven by appearance over science, noting the potential risks and higher costs associated with paper straws. The document further outlines President Trump's broader environmental policies, aiming to balance economic growth with environmental conservation. This includes enhanced forest management and energy independence while critiquing prior initiatives, including those on electric vehicle infrastructure.

**President Trump's approach prioritizes practical environmental conservation strategies over symbolic gestures.** His administration underscores the negative impacts of certain renewable energy sources, such as windmills, and promotes the responsible management of natural resources. The order promotes American energy independence with clean coal and natural gas as pivotal elements supporting both economic and security objectives.
