On February 19, 2025, a Presidential order was issued to end taxpayer subsidization of illegal immigration in the United States. The action calls for strict compliance with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which limits illegal aliens from accessing taxpayer-funded benefits. The order directs executive departments and agencies to identify and align their programs to prevent unqualified aliens from obtaining public benefits, enhance eligibility verification systems, and ensure that funding to states does not promote illegal immigration.

The order also instructs the Office of Management and Budget, alongside the DOGE Service and Domestic Policy Assistant to identify federal funding sources utilized by illegal aliens, recommending further agency actions as necessary. Furthermore, agencies are required to report any misuse of federal benefits by illegal aliens to the Department of Justice and Homeland Security. The order aims to protect taxpayer resources, uphold legal standards, and ensure benefits reach citizens and eligible residents in need.

The decree emphasizes that all measures will comply with existing laws and available appropriations, and it does not intend to create enforceable rights or benefits. This ensures that while taking these steps, the administration remains within the boundaries set by law.
