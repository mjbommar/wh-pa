The document is a Presidential Action dated January 20, 2025, focusing on securing the borders of the United States. It highlights the country's struggle over the past four years with illegal immigration, which has led to millions of undocumented entries, including potentially dangerous individuals. This situation has prompted a need for strict measures to protect national security and sovereignty. The document orders a range of actions such as the construction of physical barriers, deployment of personnel, and enforcement of detention policies to control the flow of illegal aliens.

Key policies outlined in the order include cooperating with state and local enforcement, resuming the Migrant Protection Protocols, adjusting parole policies, and enhancing international cooperation. The document mandates the collection of DNA from detained aliens to confirm familial relationships and prioritizes the prosecution of border-related offenses like human smuggling and trafficking. It also instructs relevant government officials to submit further recommendations within two weeks to enhance border security and counter foreign threats.

The measures are intended to be compliant with existing laws, subject to available funding, and aim for complete operational control of the southern U.S. border to prevent unlawful immigration. While implementing these measures, the document stresses they should not create legal rights or benefits enforceable by individuals against the U.S. government.
