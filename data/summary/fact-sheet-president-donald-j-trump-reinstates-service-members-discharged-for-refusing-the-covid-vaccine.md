On January 27, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at reinstating military service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. This order mandates the Secretary of Defense to reinstate all service members, both active and reserve, who request it. Those reinstated will receive full back pay and benefits and regain their former ranks. The reinstatement comes in response to actions by the previous Biden Administration that resulted in over 8,000 troops being dismissed purely for their vaccination status.

This Executive Order seeks to address what is termed as an 'injustice,' referencing the dismissal of service members despite their potential natural immunity and proven service records. The Biden Administration faced critiques for these dismissals, particularly as it missed its recruitment targets significantly in FY2023. Furthermore, it underlines President Trumpâ€™s 2024 pledge to rehire and financially compensate affected service members as an effort to correct past decisions surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
