On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued clarifying the role of the U.S. Armed Forces in protecting the territorial integrity of the nation. The order acknowledges the President's constitutional responsibility to safeguard U.S. sovereignty, particularly along national borders. It highlights ongoing threats like unlawful mass migration and drug trafficking as factors that necessitate military involvement in border security to maintain national peace and security.

The policy outlined in the order emphasizes the critical role of the Armed Forces in maintaining border security. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with revising the Unified Command Plan within ten days to assign the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) the mission of enforcing border security against various forms of invasion, including human smuggling and narcotics trafficking. The order includes detailed planning and assessment requirements for USNORTHCOM to ensure effective border management.

This order mandates that these actions be implemented in accordance with existing laws and the availability of resources, and it specifically states that the order does not create enforceable rights or benefits. The directive underscores the importance of safeguarding U.S. territorial integrity while coordinating these efforts within the legal framework.
