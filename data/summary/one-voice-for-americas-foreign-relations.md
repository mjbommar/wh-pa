On February 12, 2025, a presidential order was issued emphasizing the President's sole authority in conducting U.S. foreign policy as vested by Article II of the U.S. Constitution. The order outlines the roles and duties of the Secretary of State and other officials involved in implementing the President's foreign policy. The Secretary is tasked with maintaining a dedicated workforce committed to the effective implementation of these policies.

The order mandates reforms in the Foreign Service, requiring the Secretary of State to adjust recruitment, performance evaluation, and retention to align with the President's foreign agenda. Additionally, the Foreign Affairs Manual and other documents may be revised or replaced to ensure faithful policy implementation. The Secretary possesses discretion regarding these reforms and any disciplinary actions against employees who fail to uphold the policy.

The order is to be applied without impairing existing legal authorities or creating new legal rights enforceable against the U.S. It is also subject to existing law and budgetary constraints. Citations are included to provide legal backing for definitions and employee classifications.
