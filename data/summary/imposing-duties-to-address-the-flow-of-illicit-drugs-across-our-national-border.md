On February 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order to impose duties on Canadian products to address the flow of illicit drugs across the United States' northern border. Utilizing powers under several U.S. laws, the President determined that Canada has not effectively controlled drug trafficking contributing to a public health crisis in the U.S. Tariffs include a 25% ad valorem duty on most Canadian products and a 10% duty on energy resources, effective February 4, 2025. 

This action is part of an initiative to curb the increase of synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs entering the U.S. from Canadaâ€”an escalating issue that Canada has reportedly not managed adequately. The executive order involves collaboration between various U.S. departments and outlines punitive measures such as increased tariffs should Canada retaliate. The order also restricts duty-free exemptions for these goods and tasks U.S. Homeland Security officials with assessing and reporting Canada's compliance efforts.
