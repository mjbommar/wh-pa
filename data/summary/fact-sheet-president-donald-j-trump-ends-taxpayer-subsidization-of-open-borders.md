On February 19, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at preventing the use of taxpayer funds to support illegal immigration in the United States. The order directs federal departments and agencies to identify and correct federally funded programs that provide financial benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the country. It seeks to stop federal funding from supporting sanctuary policies and mandates improvements in eligibility verification for federal benefits. The intention is to preserve these resources for American citizens genuinely in need, such as veterans and individuals with disabilities.

President Trump justifies this action by highlighting the financial strain illegal immigration purportedly places on American taxpayers and resources. The executive order follows reports and estimates from various committees and organizations, suggesting that past policies have resulted in substantial costs due to the support of illegal immigrants. The action aligns with Trump's broader intent to secure the border and prioritize American citizens by reinstating border wall construction and suspending certain parole programs, amongst other measures aimed at controlling immigration.

The order is positioned against the previous administration's alleged open borders agenda, which President Trump argues exacerbated the illegal immigration problem. Efforts to rectify this include deploying additional personnel to the southern border, revoking certain executive actions, and implementing more stringent entry and removal policies for aliens. The administration's ultimate goal, as outlined, is to ensure national security and equitable distribution of federal benefits.
