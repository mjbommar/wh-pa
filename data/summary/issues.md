The Trump-Vance Administration outlines its priorities aimed at addressing various national challenges, focusing heavily on enhancing security, revamping energy policies, reforming government operations, and reinstating traditional American values. In efforts to secure America, the administration plans to implement strict border control measures including reversing the current administration's policies, enforcing immigration laws, using military resources for border security, and designating certain criminal organizations as terrorist groups. 

The energy policy will involve undoing previous regulations related to climate change to foster energy independence, rescinding the Paris Climate Accord, and reducing living costs through deregulation. Further governmental reforms are outlined to reduce bureaucracy, improve service accountability, and protect free speech. Additionally, the administration intends to maintain American values by addressing societal issues such as gender identity and historical recognition.
