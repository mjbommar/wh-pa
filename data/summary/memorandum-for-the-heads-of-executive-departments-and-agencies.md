On February 7, 2025, a memorandum was issued from the White House to the heads of executive departments and agencies. The directive emphasized the United States Government's policy to stop funding nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that act against the national interest. The memorandum highlighted concerns about taxpayer dollars funding actions by NGOs that could compromise the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people. 

The heads of these executive departments and agencies were instructed to review all current funding to NGOs. Future funding decisions should be aligned with U.S. interests as well as the administration's goals and priorities. This alignment should be determined through executive actions and based on the judgment of the heads of agencies in conjunction with applicable statutes, regulations, and terms.
