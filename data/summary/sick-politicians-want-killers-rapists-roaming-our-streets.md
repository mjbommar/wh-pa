The article discusses the actions taken by President Donald J. Trump to deport illegal immigrants involved in serious crimes from the United States. This initiative targets individuals in 'sanctuary cities' who have been convicted of crimes such as murder, rape, child endangerment, and drug-related offenses. The focus is on several high-profile arrests made by ICE in cities including Saint Paul, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Washington State; Los Angeles, California; and New York City, New York.

Despite these actions, many local politicians in these 'sanctuary' areas oppose this crackdown, citing concerns over jurisdiction and civil rights. For instance, officials in places like Saint Paul and Chicago have expressed resistance to cooperating with ICE, arguing that immigration enforcement should not interfere with local law enforcement responsibilities. Meanwhile, some members of Congress from these areas advocate for the rights of immigrants, stressing the importance of protecting communities and ensuring that individuals know their rights during immigration enforcement actions.
