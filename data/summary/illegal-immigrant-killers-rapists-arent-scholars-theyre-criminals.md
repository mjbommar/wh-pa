On February 26, 2025, an article was published on the White House website addressing the criticism from filmmaker Michael Moore regarding the deportation of illegal immigrant criminals. Moore speculates that some deported individuals might have potential to contribute significantly to society, such as discovering a cure for cancer. The article counters his argument by listing several instances where illegal immigrants committed serious crimes, underscoring the government's focus on deporting criminals to ensure public safety.

The document highlights various cases where individuals from countries like Portugal, Guatemala, Haiti, and El Salvador have been apprehended for crimes such as sexual exploitation of minors, armed invasion, multiple murders, and gang-related violence. The government uses these examples to support stringent immigration enforcement, arguing that deportation is necessary to prevent such individuals from endangering communities across the United States. The article aims to shed light on the challenges of balancing immigration policies with public safety concerns.
