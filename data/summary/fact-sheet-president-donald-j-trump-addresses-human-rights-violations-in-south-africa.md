On February 7, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order addressing human rights violations in South Africa. The focus is on the land confiscation act which targets ethnic minority descendants of settler groups by seizing their property without compensation. The order indicates that the U.S. will halt all aid and assistance to South Africa as long as it supports global bad actors and allows violent attacks on minority farmers.

The Executive Order is a response to South Africa's positions against the U.S. and its allies, such as accusations against Israel following terrorist attacks and building relations with Iran. Within South Africa, laws like the Expropriation Act are seen as dismantling equal opportunities and inciting violence against racially disfavored landowners. President Trump is committed to sending a strong message against such human rights abuses by pausing funding until a detailed investigation is complete.

This approach is aligned with President Trump's America First agenda, emphasizing a firm stance against global injustices and fostering accountability for nations like South Africa that engage in discriminatory practices and support terrorism globally. The U.S. plans to offer resettlement for those racially discriminated against under these policies.
