A recent poll conducted by Harvard CAPS-Harris indicates significant public support for President Donald J. Trump and his agenda. The survey, released in February 2025, highlights approval for various elements of Trump's policies, including the deportation of criminal illegal immigrants, enhancing border security, and a focus on reducing government fraud and inefficiency. The poll reflects a favorable view of Trump's handling of the U.S. economy, with nearly half of the respondents considering it strong, which is the highest rating since 2021. Moreover, the poll suggests a high level of optimism regarding the country's direction.

The data further illustrates public backing for Trump's efforts in reevaluating foreign aid, implementing reciprocal tariffs, and pursuing direct negotiations with Russia concerning the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, significant segments of the population support actions to protect American workers through economic tools like tariffs. Key officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., enjoy positive favorability ratings as well.

A broad consensus among Americans encourages efforts to streamline government operations, with overwhelming support for examining government expenditures thoroughly. Public sentiment favors the establishment of a governmental body dedicated to efficiency and sees Congress as a vital ally in reducing unnecessary spending. The favorability towards these efforts is consistent across different demographics, with the majority believing Trump's performance surpasses that of his predecessor, President Biden.
