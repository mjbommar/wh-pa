This document outlines an order issued by the President of the United States on January 29, 2025, aimed at combating anti-Semitism, especially in educational institutions. The order reaffirms the initiatives previously laid out in Executive Order 13899, initially issued on December 11, 2019. This reaffirmation was deemed necessary due to a significant increase in anti-Semitic acts following the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. The order mandates federal departments to utilize their jurisdictions to form strategies combating anti-Semitism in educational settings and encourages the use of appropriate legal tools against such acts.

It requires heads of executive departments to report on civil and criminal authorities that could help curb anti-Semitism and also to inventory and analyze cases pending against institutions of higher learning related to post-October 7, 2023, anti-Semitic incidents. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Education are specifically tasked with assessing court cases and Title VI complaints respectively. The Secretary of State, Secretary of Education, and Secretary of Homeland Security are to provide institutes of higher education with guidelines for monitoring activities of non-citizen students that may contravene U.S. laws. The order emphasizes implementation within the bounds of the law and the available budget.
