These actions cover a range of policy areas including election interference, accountability in the federal workforce, international relations, and economic policies. One significant action is holding former government officials accountable for election interference and improper disclosure of sensitive information, signaling a focus on safeguarding democratic processes. Additionally, the administration addressed the influence of foreign-controlled applications like TikTok under the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.

Other actions include the United States' withdrawal from the World Health Organization, implementation of policy measures to prioritize American interests in international environmental agreements, and delivering emergency relief to address the cost-of-living crisis affecting American families.
