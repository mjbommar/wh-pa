The article discusses claims made by former President Donald Trump, asserting that the Biden Administration has spent $8 million of taxpayer money on transgender animal experiments. This claim was fact-checked by CNN, but Trump insisted on its accuracy. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded grants to several research projects investigating the effects of hormone therapy and other related topics in mice. These grants include studies on hormone impacts on HIV vaccine responses, reproductive consequences in mice, breast cancer risks, microbiome effects, neuroendocrine responses, and asthma outcomes influenced by hormones.

The NIH projects received a cumulative total of $8,290,053 for conducting detailed biological studies with transgenic and gonadectomized mice, focusing on understanding hormone therapies and their implications. The projects were carried out across various institutions, as documented by the assistance funds allocated for each research aim. This controversy arises over the appropriateness of using taxpayer dollars for such research, sparking debates on wasteful spending allegations.
