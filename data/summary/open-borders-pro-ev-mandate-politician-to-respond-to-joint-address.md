The article discusses Senator Elissa Slotkin's response to President Donald J. Trump's Joint Address to Congress on March 4, 2025. Slotkin opposes President Trump's policies aimed at reducing costs, revitalizing American manufacturing, and securing the nation's borders. She has voted against several initiatives that the article suggests are central to Trump's agenda, including measures to overturn Biden's emissions rules and secure the U.S. borders.

Slotkin's legislative actions include voting against repealing an EPA rule that mandates increased electric vehicle sales, which critics argue could harm traditional auto manufacturing jobs. Studies cited in the article suggest these mandates could lead to significant job losses in states heavily reliant on auto manufacturing like Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Additionally, Slotkin's stance on immigration is addressed, noting her votes against border security measures like the Secure the Border Act and her opposition to Trump's emergency declaration at the southern border.
