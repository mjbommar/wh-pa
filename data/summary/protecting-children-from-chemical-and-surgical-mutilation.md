On January 28, 2025, a Presidential Action was issued to prohibit Federal funding and support for medical interventions that aim to change a child's sex, referred to as 'chemical and surgical mutilation'. This order highlights concerns about children undergoing irreversible medical treatments under the guidance of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which the order claims lacks scientific backing. Agencies are tasked to amend policies based on WPATH guidance and focus on improving data and research for children with gender dysphoria. 

The directive mandates that Federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, work to end these practices by revising relevant healthcare policies, funding, and insurance programs. The order affects programs like TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits, explicitly excluding coverage for transgender-related pediatric treatments. The Justice Department is ordered to enforce laws against genital mutilation and coordinate with state authorities, while also addressing potential deceit in medical practices related to gender transition.
