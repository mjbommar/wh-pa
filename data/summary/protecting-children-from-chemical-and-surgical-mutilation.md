On January 28, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order aimed at ending the practice of what is referred to as 'chemical and surgical mutilation' of children. This includes the use of puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries for transitioning minors under 19 years of age. The order mandates that no federal funding is to be used to support these practices. It also directs various government agencies to review and amend existing policies, guidance, and grants related to gender transition treatments for children.

The order includes instructions to rescind guidance that relies on standards from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which the order claims lacks scientific integrity. Instead, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must review existing literature on gender dysphoria best practices and improve the quality of data concerning minors with gender identity issues. Additionally, the order calls for revising insurance coverages under Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Federal Employee Health Benefits to exclude coverage for these procedures.

Agencies like the Department of Justice are tasked with prioritizing enforcement against practices like female genital mutilation and ensuring consumer protection against misleading claims on gender transition interventions. The order also highlights legal strategies to protect children and support parents who oppose gender transition interventions for their child. Agencies must report progress on these directives within 60 days to facilitate coordinated government action.
