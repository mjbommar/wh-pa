On February 18, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at increasing accountability within the federal government by ensuring that all federal agencies adhere to the supervision of the President. The Executive Order emphasizes that the President, according to Article II of the U.S. Constitution, holds all executive power and therefore has oversight over all executive branch officials and employees. As part of the directive, independent agencies will be required to submit their draft regulations for review by the White House and consult with it on their priorities and strategic plans. Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget will oversee financial allocations to ensure efficient use of tax dollars.

The Executive Order specifically targets independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which were previously operating without direct Presidential oversight. These agencies will now be accountable for their rule-making processes, financial expenditures, and performance standards under the purview of the President. This initiative seeks to reinforce democratic principles by making the government more accountable to the electorate and aligning all federal agencies with constitutional governance.

By restoring oversight, President Trump's order aims to assure voters that all federal entities are justifiably accountable for their actions and decisions. The overarching goal is to cultivate a governance system where the executive branch is answerable to the public, aligning with the Founders' vision of a government that serves its citizens responsibly and transparently.
