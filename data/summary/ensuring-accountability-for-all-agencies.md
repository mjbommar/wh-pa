This order issued on February 18, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to increase accountability across all federal agencies and ensure their alignment with the President's intentions. The order targets independent regulatory agencies, which have previously operated with considerable autonomy, often exercising significant executive power without oversight from the President. To address this, the order mandates that all significant regulatory actions be reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office before publication.

The directive also involves modifying existing rules from a 1993 Executive Order, requiring independent regulatory agency submissions to be reviewed by the OIRA. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is tasked with establishing performance standards for agency heads and ensuring agency activities reflect presidential policies. Consultation between agencies and various offices in the Executive Office of the President is required, ensuring coordination of policy direction and strategic plans. Furthermore, the order emphasizes that the President's and Attorney Generalâ€™s legal interpretations are binding for all federal employees, reflecting the order's broader intent to centralize executive accountability.
