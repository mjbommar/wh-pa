The document, issued by the President of the United States on January 27, 2025, outlines a directive to develop a next-generation missile defense shield to protect against advanced aerial attacks, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. This effort aims to enhance national security by deploying cutting-edge defense systems and ensuring a secure second-strike capability. The order is a continuation of previous U.S. strategies to maintain military superiority and counter the growing threats posed by peer and near-peer adversaries.

Under this directive, the Secretary of Defense is tasked with developing a comprehensive plan, including a reference architecture and capabilities-based requirements, for the timely implementation of this defense shield. It emphasizes the importance of accelerating certain technological deployments and strengthening the supply chain's security and resilience. Moreover, the order calls for increased cooperation with allies and partners to improve theater missile defenses internationally, thereby ensuring the protection of alliesâ€™ populations and U.S. troops stationed abroad.

The order also mandates a review of the strategic missile threat to the homeland and identifies prioritized locations for defense deployment, ensuring a methodical approach to counter potential nuclear adversaries. The initiative aligns with the U.S. policy of 'peace through strength' and is subject to the availability of appropriations and existing laws.
