On January 27, 2025, a Presidential Action titled 'The Iron Dome for America' was announced, highlighting the strategic importance of a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States. The directive outlines the continued threat of advanced aerial attacks, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles, and emphasizes the need for effective defense mechanisms against these evolving threats. It draws parallels to former President Ronald Reagan's initiatives and notes the intensifying advancements in strategic weapons by adversaries, advocating for a proactive policy to ensure national security.

The document mandates that within 60 days, the Secretary of Defense must submit a comprehensive plan, referencing architecture and requirements for the missile defense system. This includes defense against a wide array of missile threats and the development of space-based interceptors and other strategic capabilities. The plan must include funding strategies, cooperative defense efforts with allies, and updated threat assessments. This initiative underscores a robust national defense policy aiming to strengthen missile defense capabilities and international collaborations.

Additionally, the directive seeks to enhance U.S. allied defense relationships by directing reviews of theater missile defenses and increasing cooperation with partners on missile defense technologies and operations. The policy underscores a commitment to maintaining peace through strength and the nation's ability to deter and defend against any aerial threat to its sovereignty.
