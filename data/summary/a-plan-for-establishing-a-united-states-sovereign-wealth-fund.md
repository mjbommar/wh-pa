On February 3, 2025, an executive order was issued by the President of the United States to establish a sovereign wealth fund aimed at promoting the financial health and international leadership of the country. The objective is to enhance the national wealth for the benefit of American citizens by ensuring fiscal sustainability, reducing tax burdens for families and small businesses, securing economic futures, and strengthening the nation's global economic leadership. 

The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, to devise a detailed plan for creating and administering the sovereign wealth fund. This plan must include strategies for funding, investment, structuring, and governance, while also assessing legal considerations and potential legislative needs. The plan is expected to be submitted to the President within 90 days of the order's date.

The general provisions clarify the order's non-impact on existing legal authority and budgetary processes and emphasize that it does not establish enforceable rights or benefits for any parties. The implementation of this order must align with existing laws and available appropriations.
