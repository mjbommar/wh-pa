The White House issued a presidential message on February 15, 2025, to commemorate the birthday of Susan B. Anthony, a pivotal figure in advocating for women's rights and equality. Susan B. Anthony is celebrated for her relentless efforts in advancing the Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote, as well as her dedication to the abolitionist movement and the protection of life. 

The President highlighted his administration's commitment to Susan B. Anthony's causes by mentioning efforts such as the signing of an Executive Order to protect women's sports and ceasing taxpayer-funded abortions. Furthermore, the First Lady, Melania Trump, was acknowledged for her role in promoting women's empowerment, including hosting a White House event celebrating the centennial of the Nineteenth Amendment. Together, they honor Anthony's legacy and encourage a culture that cherishes freedom and dignity for all Americans.
