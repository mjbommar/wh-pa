On February 19, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced new appointments to the Council of Governors, a bipartisan group designed to improve federal and state collaboration on national security, disaster response, and military matters. The Council, co-chaired by Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin and North Carolina's Governor Josh Stein, includes governors from various states, such as Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. This initiative aims to bolster partnerships between state and federal governments in key security areas.

The Council of Governors was established under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 and was further formalized by Executive Order 13528 in 2010. It functions as a critical platform for communication and coordination between state governors and federal officials, particularly concerning the National Guard and other military operations within the states. This collaboration is crucial for effective disaster response and national security measures.
