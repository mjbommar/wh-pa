In February 2025, President Donald J. Trump took decisive action to protect American industries by reinstating and increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with steel tariffs set at 25% and aluminum tariffs raised to 25%. This move follows similar policies from his first term which had been weakened by loopholes and exemptions. The announcement was met with widespread approval from industry leaders, union representatives, and Republican lawmakers who believe these tariffs will help mitigate threats posed by foreign competitors, especially from countries like China and Mexico, accused of unfair trade practices.

Industry leaders like Philip K. Bell of the Steel Manufacturers Association and Charles Johnson of the Aluminum Association expressed support, emphasizing the tariffs' roles in leveling the competitive field for U.S. manufacturers and enhancing domestic production. Lawmakers, including Senators Jim Banks and Tim Scott, praised the tariffs as a necessary means to protect American workers, citing their long-term benefits for national security and economic stability. Leaders across industry and government see these tariffs as vital steps to restore and safeguard Americaâ€™s industrial base through enforceable trade policies.
