On February 4, 2025, a Presidential Memorandum was issued to several key national security and economic officials, detailing the United States' strategy to impose maximum pressure on Iran. The memorandum underscores Iran's activities as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and accuses it of supporting various terrorist groups and committing human rights abuses. The memorandum reflects the administration's policy to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and to curtail its ballistic missile program, emphasizing the need to neutralize Iran's influence and aggression in the region.

The memorandum outlines directives for several departments and government agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with imposing sanctions and denying Iran and its proxies revenue. The Secretary of State is instructed to lead efforts to diplomatically isolate Iran and drive down its oil exports. Other roles include the UN Representative pushing for international sanctions, the Secretary of Commerce enforcing export controls, and the Attorney General taking legal action against Iranian networks. This comprehensive approach aims to disrupt Iran's malign activities and curb its nuclear ambitions.

Overall, the memorandum serves as a detailed policy directive to various branches of the U.S. government, advocating for stringent measures to counteract Iran's perceived threats by applying a multi-faceted strategy involving diplomatic, economic, and legal tools.
