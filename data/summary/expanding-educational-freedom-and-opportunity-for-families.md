On January 29, 2025, a presidential order was issued to expand educational freedom and opportunities for families in the United States. Concerned with the inadequate performance of many government-run K-12 schools in addressing essential reading and math skills, the new policy aims to empower parents with greater control over their childrenâ€™s education. Through initiatives like state-driven K-12 scholarship programs and educational choice, the government seeks to enhance the educational landscape by promoting competition and choice.

The order sets out several actionable steps for different federal departments. The Secretary of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, Defense, and Interior are instructed to review and potentially allocate federal funds towards supporting educational choice. These funds could be used for alternatives like private and faith-based schools, particularly to benefit low-income families, military families, and children eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools. All actions must comply with existing laws and are subject to budgetary considerations.

This initiative underscores the administration's commitment to educational reform by involving federal support in state-led educational alternatives. It emphasizes better performance, equity in educational access, and improved national competitiveness through diverse educational options.
