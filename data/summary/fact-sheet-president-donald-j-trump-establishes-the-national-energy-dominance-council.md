**National Energy Dominance Council Established by President Trump**: On February 14, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to form the National Energy Dominance Council. Chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and vice-chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Council will include members of the President's cabinet and key government agencies. Its primary aim is to advise the President on achieving energy dominance by streamlining processes in permitting, production, and distribution of American energy. The Council will work with various stakeholders to advance energy production, cut red tape, and enhance private sector investment.

**Focus on Domestic Energy Production and Economic Security**: The plan emphasizes reducing U.S. reliance on foreign energy, criticizing the previous administration for policies that allegedly hindered domestic energy production and citing the increased energy costs under President Biden. The proposal outlines the need for domestic independence to strengthen the national supply chain and economic security. It also highlights past successes in the LNG sector and energy exports under Trump's leadership as critical to achieving energy stability. 

**Restoration of American Energy Dominance**: The Council's recommendations aim to restore the U.S. to a state of energy dominance, as seen during Trump's first term. Strategies include expediting licensing processes for exports, reducing permitting times for drilling, and fostering American energy jobs. The document underscores the economic benefits these policies provided American families previously, presenting a case for their reinstatement.
