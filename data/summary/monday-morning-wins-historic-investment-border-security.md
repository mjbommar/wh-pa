On February 24, 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a significant $500 billion investment by the company in the United States over the next four years. This landmark decision follows a meeting with President Donald J. Trump and comes amid President Trump's push for tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. This initiative is expected to result in 20,000 new jobs and is hailed as a critical step in revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.

Additionally, a report indicates that many potential illegal immigrants have turned back to their countries due to the Trump Administration's rigorous measures against illegal immigration. The administration's actions include shutting down the 'CBP One' app, leading to historically low illegal border crossings and increased interior arrests. These actions reflect a fulfillment of President Trump's promises to enhance national security and protect U.S. borders.
