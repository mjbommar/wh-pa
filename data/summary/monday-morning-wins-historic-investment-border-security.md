On February 24, 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a $500 billion investment in the United States over the next four years. This decision aligns with President Donald J. Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, and is expected to create 20,000 new jobs in the U.S. The announcement marks a significant move toward revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, following a series of commitments and investments from countries and companies like Saudi Arabia and Mercedes-Benz, further solidifying President Trump's vision for economic growth.

Furthermore, there have been reports of a significant reduction in illegal border crossings, with some would-be immigrants returning to their home countries. This outcome is attributed to President Trump's stringent immigration policies, which include halting certain functionalities of the CBP One app. These efforts have resulted in a 94% decrease in illegal crossings compared to the previous year and a marked increase in interior arrests, reflecting a substantial shift in border security measures.
