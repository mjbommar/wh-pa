On February 14, 2025, a Presidential Executive Order was issued to establish the National Energy Dominance Council. The council's primary goal is to position America as a leading global force in energy production. By enhancing energy production from various sources such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, and renewable resources, the nation aims to secure economic prosperity and national security. The council, coordinated by the Secretary of the Interior as Chair and the Secretary of Energy as Vice Chair, includes key members from several governmental departments.

The council will advise the President on promoting reliable and affordable energy by streamlining processes related to energy production and exports and proposing a strategy for energy dominance. This strategy will focus on reducing regulatory burdens and fostering private sector investments. The council will also work to encourage interagency cooperation to enhance energy production and address constraints that could drive higher consumer costs.

Importantly, the council is tasked with reviewing and advising on policies related to energy markets and national awareness of the significance of energy dominance. It will seek feedback from state and local governments, as well as private sector stakeholders, to refine and expand energy production initiatives across the country.
