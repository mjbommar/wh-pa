**Establishing a New Faith Office**: On February 7, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to create the White House Faith Office. This office is designed to provide support to faith-based entities, community organizations, and places of worship in their efforts to aid families and communities. It is part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work with faith community experts to provide recommendations to the President about aligning policies and practices with American values. Additionally, the office will work with government agencies to deliver religious liberty training and grant opportunities to faith-based non-profits and communities, and collaborate with the Attorney General to address failures in enforcing religious liberty protections.

**Commitment to Religious Liberty**: President Trump emphasized his pledge to protect religious freedoms for communities, groups, and individuals. In his first week, he pardoned certain Christians and pro-life activists perceived as persecuted by the previous administration and reinstated military service members dismissed due to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, specifically those with religious objections. Furthermore, recent executive actions were signed to ensure federal policies do not infringe on religious beliefs, such as a task force to combat anti-Christian bias.

**Building on Past Initiatives**: These steps are in line with efforts from Trump's first term to uphold religious freedom. Actions taken in previous years, such as halting the Johnson Amendment in 2017, initiating the Faith and Opportunity Initiative in 2018, and hosting a Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom in 2019, highlight a consistent focus on religious protections and the role of faith-based organizations in the public sphere.
