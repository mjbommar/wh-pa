On January 23, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at enhancing America's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). This action revokes an existing Executive Order from the Biden Administration, which Trump claims imposed restrictions on AI research and development that were harmful to innovation and detrimental to America's technological leadership. Trump's new directive seeks to dismantle these barriers and to empower private sector growth in AI by asking governmental departments and agencies to amend any policies that do not align with this objective.

The Executive Order stresses the United States' commitment to retaining dominance in AI to boost economic competitiveness and national security. President Trump directs the creation of an AI Action Plan, led by key White House officials, to ensure America remains at the forefront of AI advancement. Additionally, it requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to update federal AI acquisition guidelines to eliminate hindrances to AI progress in the country.

This order continues President Trump's ongoing efforts, dating back to his first term, to prioritize AI development. Previously, his administration focused on doubling investment in AI research, establishing national AI research institutes, and formulating AI regulatory guidance. This latest Executive Order builds on these initiatives with the aim to uphold free speech and support human flourishing in the context of advancing AI technologies.
