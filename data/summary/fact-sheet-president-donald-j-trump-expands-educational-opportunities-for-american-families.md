On January 30, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at expanding educational opportunities and choices for American families. The order emphasizes the role of parents in deciding the educational path of their children and directs various federal departments to promote school choice initiatives. The Department of Education is instructed to support state K-12 scholarship programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense are tasked with facilitating educational alternatives for families, including private and faith-based options. Additionally, the Secretary of the Interior is to evaluate how families at Bureau of Indian Education schools might utilize federal funds for school choice.

The Executive Order seeks to address shortcomings in the traditional government-assigned education system, which has not met parental or student expectations. The U.S. educational outcomes, according to recent data, have stagnated despite significant financial investments, highlighting the need for this school choice initiative. The order also aims to fulfill President Trump's promise to enhance educational freedom, drawing on past efforts such as advocating for the School Choice Now Act and increasing public charter school funding.

There is strong public support for school choice, with significant backing from Democrats, Black Americans, and Hispanic Americans. The Executive Order envisions enabling every family the option to provide their children with a tailored, high-quality education through various educational choices.
