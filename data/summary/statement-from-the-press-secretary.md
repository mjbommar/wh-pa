On January 26, 2025, a statement from the Press Secretary announced that the Government of Colombia has agreed to comply with terms set by President Trump regarding the deportation of Colombian nationals. Under these terms, Colombia will accept illegal aliens returned from the United States without restrictions and delays, even via U.S. military aircraft. In exchange, the United States will hold in reserve any proposed tariffs and sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), provided Colombia honors the agreement.

The statement clarifies that visa sanctions by the U.S. State Department and enhanced inspections at Customs and Border Protection will remain in effect until the first batch of Colombian deportees is successfully sent back. This action is presented as a demonstration of restored respect and sovereignty for America on the international stage. President Trump is committed to enforcing national sovereignty and expects other nations to similarly cooperate in taking back their citizens who are present illegally in the United States.
