**Fact Sheet on Digital Financial Technology Leadership:** On January 23, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at reinforcing the United States' leadership in digital financial technology. The order calls for establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This group, chaired by the White House AI & Crypto Czar, will develop a federally regulated framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluate the potential for a strategic national digital assets stockpile. The Executive Order seeks to coordinate efforts among federal entities to manage regulations that affect the digital assets sector and advises against promoting central bank digital currencies.

Additionally, the Executive Order revokes previous policies that hindered innovation and threatened U.S. economic freedom and leadership in digital finance. President Trump promises to deter regulatory overreach that stunted growth in this sector under past administrations. The administration's new approach is designed to foster a thriving environment for digital financial technology to protect economic freedom while establishing clear regulatory guidelines.
