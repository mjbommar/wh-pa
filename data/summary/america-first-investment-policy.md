On February 21, 2025, the American government issued a Presidential Memorandum titled "America First Investment Policy," which outlines new guidelines for foreign investment in the United States. The memorandum emphasizes preserving an open investment environment while protecting national security interests from predatory investments, particularly those originating from adversarial nations like the People's Republic of China (PRC). The policy aims to attract investments from allied nations while preventing strategic sectors from being influenced or owned by adversarial foreign entities.

This policy identifies foreign investments in critical technology and infrastructures, stressing the importance of safeguarding American assets from exploitation. Measures include restricting investments in technologies integral to the PRCâ€™s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and calling for a thorough review of existing financial agreements, such as the 1984 Income Tax Convention with China, to ensure they do not support adversarial advances. The memorandum also mandates various government departments to implement these policies effectively, promoting a secure and economically beneficial investment landscape for the United States.
