On February 18, 2025, the President issued an order to emphasize the importance of expanding access to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) for Americans experiencing fertility challenges. Recognizing the emotional and financial struggles associated with infertility, the administration aims to make IVF treatments more affordable and accessible. Due to the high costs of IVF, which can range from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, the administration seeks to ease unnecessary statutory and regulatory burdens to support family formation. 

As part of this initiative, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy is tasked with providing recommendations within 90 days on ways to ensure the protection of IVF access while reducing out-of-pocket and health plan expenses. The executive order clarifies that it does not interfere with existing legal authorities and should be implemented according to the law and budgetary constraints. This order does not establish legally enforceable rights or benefits for individuals against the government.
