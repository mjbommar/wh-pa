On January 24, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order in response to devastating wildfires in Southern California, particularly in Los Angeles. These fires have resulted in significant loss of life and property, prompting federal intervention. The order calls for a coordinated effort by several federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Interior, to override state and local policies that hinder effective water resource management. This includes measures to maximize water deliveries and expedite regulatory processes to better manage water supply and fire-related disasters.

The executive order also outlines additional measures to support affected families, particularly focusing on housing displaced persons and removing debris to facilitate reconstruction efforts. It includes actions for addressing mismanagement of disaster funds in California and similar support for North Carolina, which is recovering from Hurricane Helene. The order emphasizes the need to ensure compliance with federal funding requirements and aims to improve disaster response capabilities for future incidents.

Federal agencies are tasked with identifying and removing regulatory barriers, ensuring compliance with existing laws such as the Endangered Species Act, and coordinating efforts between state and federal entities. The order asserts the federal government's authority to prioritize national interests over conflicting state policies in disaster-affected areas.
