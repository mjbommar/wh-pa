### Summary

On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order regarding the 'Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,' particularly in connection to the social media platform TikTok. The Act, enacted as Public Law 118-50, Division H, regulates foreign-owned applications like TikTok for national security reasons. Section 2(a) specifically prohibits distribution, maintenance, or updating of these applications within the United States. This ban, intended to curb influence from foreign adversaries like ByteDance Ltd., TikTok's parent company, became effective immediately before the new President took office.

To evaluate and address these security concerns without causing a disruptive shutdown of TikTok, which is used by 170 million Americans, the President postponed enforcement of the bans for 75 days. During this period, the Department of Justice is instructed to refrain from taking actions that would enforce the Act or penalize non-compliance, allowing the administration to assess options, review intelligence, and consult with advisors. The Attorney General is tasked with protecting executive authority in this matter and clarifying non-liability for actions taken during this pause period.
