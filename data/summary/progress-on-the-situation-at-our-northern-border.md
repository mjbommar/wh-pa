On February 3, 2025, the President of the United States issued an order addressing a national security threat posed by drug trafficking and illegal migration across the northern border with Canada. By invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and other legal frameworks, the President initially imposed tariffs on Canadian goods due to Canada's insufficient actions against these threats. The government of Canada has since taken steps to combat these issues, leading the President to pause the implementation of additional tariffs until March 4, 2025, to give time for further assessment of Canada's efforts.

During this pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, alongside key officials, will continue evaluating the situation to determine if the steps taken by Canada adequately mitigate the crisis. If the situation worsens or Canada fails in its efforts, the President will enforce the previously stated tariffs. The order also outlines severability and general provisions to ensure the continuity and enforceability of its terms, regardless of potential legal challenges.
