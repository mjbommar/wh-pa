This document is an executive order issued on January 20, 2025, by the President of the United States. It outlines the United States' intention to withdraw from international environmental agreements that are considered not to reflect the country's values or interests. The focus is on ensuring that any international commitments do not unfairly burden the U.S. economy or direct taxpayer money to countries that do not warrant such financial support.

Specifically, the order mandates the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to announce the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and any similar commitments. The order also rescinds financial commitments under these agreements and calls for a report on actions taken to revoke policies that were developed to support the International Climate Finance Plan. It further directs multiple government departments and agencies to prioritize economic efficiency and American interests in international energy engagements.

The order includes a number of procedural stipulations, ensuring that its implementation does not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary proceedings, and clarifying that it does not create enforceable legal rights for any party.
