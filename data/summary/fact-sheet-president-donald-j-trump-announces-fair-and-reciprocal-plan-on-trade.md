President Donald J. Trump announced the "Fair and Reciprocal Plan" on February 13, 2025, through a Presidential Memorandum. This plan is designed to restore fairness in U.S. trade relationships and confront non-reciprocal trading arrangements that have placed American industries and workers at a disadvantage. The memorandum outlines discrepancies in tariff rates and market accessibility between the U.S. and its major trading partners, such as Brazil, India, and the European Union, highlighting instances where American exports face higher tariffs and restrictions. 

The memorandum emphasizes America's intent to no longer tolerate these perceived unfair trade practices. It highlights issues like high foreign tariffs on American products, digital service taxes imposed by other countries, and the historical trade deficit that the U.S. experiences. The plan aims to implement reciprocal tariffs to ensure fair treatment for American businesses and protect national economic and security interests. 

President Trumpâ€™s previous efforts in trade are recounted, including the replacement of NAFTA with the USMCA, and the use of tariffs to protect American interests against oversupplied markets and intellectual property challenges from China. Recently, tariffs were also used to effect changes in border policies with Canada and Mexico, demonstrating his commitment to putting America first in international trade agreements.
