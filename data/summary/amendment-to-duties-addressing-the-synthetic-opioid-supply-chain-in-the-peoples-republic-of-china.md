On February 5, 2025, a presidential amendment was issued regarding the duties related to the synthetic opioid supply chain in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. This amendment modifies subsection (g) of section 2 from a previous executive order dated February 1, 2025, concerning the management of duties imposed on this supply chain. The amended order specifies that duty-free *de minimis* treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1321, applicable to certain covered articles, will no longer be available once the Secretary of Commerce notifies the President that appropriate systems are in place to process and collect the required tariffs effectively.

The document outlines the general provisions ensuring that the order does not interfere with existing legal authorities of executive departments or the function of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is subject to current laws and appropriations, and it clarifies that it does not establish any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its personnel for any entity or individual. This move reflects the administration's ongoing efforts to regulate the trade of synthetic opioids and their precursors more stringently, aiming to better monitor and manage importation and ensure proper taxation.
