On February 6, 2025, a Presidential Action was issued to address anti-Christian bias and protect religious freedoms in the United States. The order outlines a policy to stop governmental actions perceived as targeting Christian practices and individuals, especially those who were accused of anti-abortion activities under the previous administration. The current administration emphasizes the protection of religious liberty, citing U.S. constitutional rights and other laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

To implement these changes, the order establishes a Task Force within the Department of Justice to identify and rectify alleged anti-Christian conduct by governmental bodies. The task force is chaired by the Attorney General and includes several cabinet members and agency heads. It will review past governmental actions, develop protective strategies for religious liberties, and report its findings to the President. The task force aims to enhance enforcement against anti-Christian acts and suggest necessary legislative or executive measures to safeguard religious practices.

Moreover, the order mandates that the Task Force submits various reports on their findings and progress within specified timeframes. This executive move comes amid reported increases in hostility against Christian institutions and aims to ensure that the government upholds protections against discrimination and hostility based on religion.
