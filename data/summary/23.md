The document is a collection of recent presidential actions published on the White House website, dated January 20, 2025. It highlights several key decisions taken by the U.S. President, including withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, addressing TikTok via the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, and granting pardons related to events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The actions emphasize a focus on domestic policy priorities like environmental agreements, emergency price relief, a hiring freeze, a regulatory freeze, and returning to in-person work. Additionally, there are moves aimed at protecting freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.

These presidential actions seem geared towards recalibrating the U.S. stance on international cooperation bodies and focusing heavily on domestic issues. The educational and policy changes proposed suggest a retrenchment from global organizations in favor of national autonomy, as well as an attempt to reassert certain freedoms domestically. Each action listed provides a direct link for more detailed information on the White House website, organized under the category of 'Presidential Actions.'
