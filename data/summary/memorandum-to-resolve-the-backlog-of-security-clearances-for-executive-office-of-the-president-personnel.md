On January 20, 2025, a memorandum was issued to resolve a backlog of security clearances for personnel working in the Executive Office of the President. The document highlights the need for qualified and trusted individuals to fulfill their responsibilities effectively in support of the Administration's objectives for the American people. Due to a backlog in processing security clearances under the previous administration, many hired individuals have been unable to access necessary facilities and technology to carry out their duties, prompting the issuance of this memorandum.

The memorandum mandates the White House Counsel to provide a list of employees who are to receive interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information clearances for up to six months. This allows them immediate access to requisite facilities and technology. Additionally, the White House Counsel is given the authority to update this list as needed and revoke clearances if required. The memorandum clarifies that it does not create enforceable rights or benefits against the U.S. government at law or in equity.
