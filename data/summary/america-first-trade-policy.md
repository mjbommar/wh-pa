The document is a presidential memorandum dated January 20, 2025, establishing an 'America First Trade Policy.' It outlines directives for various U.S. officials, including the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Commerce, and others, to take significant actions aimed at addressing economic and national security concerns related to trade. The memorandum emphasizes reviewing trade deficits, currency manipulation, unfair trade practices, and bilateral agreements, among other economic policies.

The memorandum mandates investigations into persistent trade deficits, recommends possible tariffs, and suggests the establishment of an External Revenue Service (ERS) for collecting tariffs. It also highlights the need for a review of the USMCA and evaluates currency practices of major trading partners. Issues of intellectual property rights with China and U.S. participation in global trade agreements are also focal areas. Additionally, it calls for a review of the industrial base and export controls to ensure national security.

Reports on these actions are to be coordinated and delivered by various department heads by specified dates in 2025. The memorandum makes clear that it does not intend to create legal rights enforceable against the government, ensuring its actions conform to existing laws and available appropriations.
