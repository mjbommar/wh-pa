On January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation addressing the issue of illegal immigration at the southern border of the United States. In this proclamation, the President asserts that the current situation qualifies as an 'invasion' under Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which obligates the federal government to protect states against invasion. He invokes his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Constitution to suspend the entry of aliens engaged in this invasion and implement measures to regain control over the border.

The proclamation highlights deficiencies in the existing immigration system, particularly concerning the inability to adequately screen for health, safety, and security threats posed by individuals crossing the southern border illegally. It outlines new directives for the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, to take operational actions to address the crisis, potentially including repulsion, repatriation, and removal of individuals involved in the invasion until the President determines that the threat has subsided.

This document affirms the President's inherent authority to protect U.S. sovereignty and enhance border regulation, especially during emergencies that render current immigration provisions ineffective. It suspends the physical entry of aliens deemed part of this ongoing invasion and imposes restrictions on their ability to invoke provisions of U.S. immigration law that would allow their continued presence in the country.
