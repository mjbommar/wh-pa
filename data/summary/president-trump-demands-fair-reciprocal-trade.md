On February 13, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced a plan to establish fair, free, and reciprocal trade, emphasizing the need for the United States to address imbalances where foreign trading partners maintain closed markets to U.S. exports. This initiative seeks to ensure a level playing field by implementing reciprocal tariffs, where tariffs imposed on U.S. products will be mirrored on products imported from those countries. The administration's move has garnered widespread support from various sectors, including energy, steel, and transportation, who expressed that these measures will restore competitiveness and fairness in international trade.
