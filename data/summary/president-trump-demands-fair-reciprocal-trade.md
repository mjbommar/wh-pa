On February 13, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced a comprehensive plan for fair, free, and reciprocal trade. This plan aims to address trade imbalances and protect American workers by ensuring reciprocal access to foreign markets. Trump's plan has garnered praise from various sectors, including representatives from the American steel and ethanol industries, along with political figures, as it addresses long-standing unfair trade practices by implementing reciprocal tariffs and promoting 'America First' policies. 

The announcement received strong support from industry associations and political leaders who argue that foreign unfair trade policies, like subsidies and tariffs, have negatively impacted U.S. industries. By matching tariffs imposed by other countries, the administration seeks to eliminate market barriers for U.S. products, thus leveling the playing field in international trade. Key stakeholders including members of Congress and administration officials echoed support, emphasizing the potential economic benefits and job creation opportunities resulting from this policy shift.
