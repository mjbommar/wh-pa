In February 28, 2025, White House Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing, Peter Navarro, emphasized in an op-ed for *USA Today* the importance of President Trump's aluminum tariffs. Navarro argues that these tariffs extend beyond merely trade agreements; they signify a defense of the American aluminum industry, which he deems crucial for national security and economic stability. He claims that the tariffs will help revitalize the domestic industry, ending what he perceives as a downturn during the previous administration's tenure.

Navarro mentions how President Trump's decisions aim to restore the American aluminum sector to its former prominence, addressing the decline allegedly suffered under President Biden's administration. He suggests that the tariffs could lead to a revival of smelters and increased capacity utilization, fostering a renewed 'golden age' of manufacturing in this sector.
