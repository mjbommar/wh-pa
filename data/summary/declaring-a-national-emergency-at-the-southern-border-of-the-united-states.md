On January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States. This decision stems from the perceived threats posed by cartels, criminals, human traffickers, and the influx of illegal drugs and unvetted individuals crossing the border, which are considered grave threats to the nation. The proclamation directs the Armed Forces to assist Homeland Security in securing the border and involves deploying military resources and constructing barriers. 

The proclamation outlines several directives aimed at achieving operational control over the border area. This includes the deployment of additional personnel and resources, construction of physical barriers, and implementing strategies to counter unmanned aerial systems near the border. It also involves collaborating with willing State Governors for additional infrastructure and possible policy revisions to prioritize security. Furthermore, previous proclamations that terminated the southern border emergency are revoked, and detailed reporting requirements are set for the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security.
