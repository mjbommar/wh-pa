# Summary

President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on February 11, 2025, announcing changes to U.S. import tariffs on aluminum and derivative aluminum products, following a recommendation from the Secretary of Commerce. The proclamation notes an increase in global aluminum production, particularly from China and South America, leading to an influx of aluminum imports into the U.S. The excessive imports threaten national security by compromising domestic aluminum production capacities, prompting an increase in the ad valorem tariff from 10% to 25% starting March 12, 2025. Additionally, the proclamation terminates previous agreements with several nations, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and the UK, subjecting them to the new tariff rate.

The proclamation highlights the economic impact on the domestic aluminum industry, observing production declines and smelter shutdowns. It also addresses issues like tariff circumvention and increased imports of derivative aluminum articles, recommending enhanced tariff enforcement. The exclusion process for certain aluminum products will be terminated, ensuring that domestic industries are not undercut by high import volumes. The Secretary of Commerce is tasked with monitoring and potentially expanding the range of affected aluminum products subject to tariffs.
