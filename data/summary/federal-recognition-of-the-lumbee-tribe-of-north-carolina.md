The memorandum dated January 23, 2025, is addressed to the Secretary of the Interior and focuses on the federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Lumbee Tribe, historically known as the People of the Dark Water, has a rich cultural heritage, with members descending from various tribal nations, including the Hatteras, Tuscarora, and Cheraw. Despite being recognized as an Indian tribe by North Carolina in 1885 and as Lumbee Indians by the U.S. in 1956, they were denied federal benefits associated with such recognition. In response to recent legislative efforts, the memorandum emphasizes the United States' policy to support full federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe.

This document directs the Secretary of the Interior to create a plan within 90 days to assist the Lumbee Tribe in obtaining full federal recognition by consulting with the tribe's leadership. The plan must explore all possible legal pathways, such as Congressional acts, judicial actions, or federal acknowledgment procedures in 25 C.F.R. Part 83. The Secretary is further tasked with publishing this memorandum in the Federal Register to ensure visibility and official documentation.
