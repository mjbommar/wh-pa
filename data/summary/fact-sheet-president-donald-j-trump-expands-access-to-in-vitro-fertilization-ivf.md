On February 18, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans. This order tasks policy recommendations focused on reducing both out-of-pocket expenses and insurance costs linked to IVF treatments, while also ensuring reliable access to these services. It acknowledges that family formation is crucial and intends to simplify the path for mothers and fathers wishing to have children.

Many couples in the U.S. are unable to conceive and face financial challenges accessing IVF, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle. Current insurance coverage for IVF is limited, with only a small number of employers offering coverage. Some states mandate IVF coverage in their insurance plans, and the federal government offers limited coverage for certain groups. To support family growth, President Trump's previous administration also made policy changes like doubling the child tax credit and allowing new parents to withdraw from retirement funds without penalty.

The move to enhance IVF accessibility comes as the U.S. fertility rate is at a historic low, continuing a declining trend over recent years. President Trump made a commitment to assist families with the costs associated with having more babies, advocating for improved reproductive health policies and financial supports for families intending to grow.
