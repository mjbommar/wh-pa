On February 12, 2025, a memo was issued to the press corps highlighting significant fraudulent expenditures within the federal government. In response to an article by the New York Times, which claimed the lack of proof for sweeping accusations of fraud, the memo referenced a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The report indicated that no sector of the federal government is exempt from fraud, estimating potential annual losses between $233 billion and $521 billion.

The memo emphasized President Donald J. Trump's commitment to safeguarding taxpayer money by addressing fraudulent and inefficient spending. The government aims to use available tools and technologies to identify, quantify, and mitigate these instances of fraud to better manage federal expenditures.
