President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order titled 'Declassification of Records Concerning the Assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.' on January 23, 2025. This order mandates the declassification and release of all related records to provide transparency and truth to the American public and the victims' families, more than 50 years after the events. The order requires the Director of National Intelligence to develop a plan for the full release of JFK assassination records within 15 days and a thorough review of the RFK and MLK assassination records, with a full release plan within 45 days.

President Trump aims to eliminate previous delays, noting past actions since his first term and subsequent postponements by President Biden. In 1992, the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act required all records to be released within 25 years unless a presidential certification permitted postponement for reasons of national security or other significant concerns. Trump's current order declares that the public interest now surpasses the need for continued confidentiality of these records. During his campaign, Trump promised an early release of these documents, emphasizing the importance of revealing the truth to the public.

The order reflects a commitment to the transparency of historical records and fulfills Trump's campaign promises by addressing the long-standing issue of delayed declassification. This action underscores a conscious effort toward governmental transparency and public access to information related to historical assassinations.
