On February 21, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a National Security Presidential Memorandum designed to enhance foreign investment in the U.S. while protecting national security, particularly against threats from the People's Republic of China. The memorandum focuses on accelerating investment processes from allied countries while imposing restrictions on investments from adversaries such as China. This involves a fast-track process for investments over $1 billion and enhanced oversight by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). The memorandum also addresses the need to protect U.S. farmland and strategic industries, restricts China's access to sensitive technologies, and proposes new rules to limit U.S. investments in Chinese technologies.

President Trump's initiative underscores the importance of balancing economic growth with national security. The memorandum seeks to prevent foreign entities, particularly Chinese, from exploiting American resources and technologies. This policy builds on previous actions by Trump against foreign exploitation, including investigations into technology transfer and intellectual property theft. The administration aims to protect American innovation by limiting adversarial investments and ensuring U.S. companies do not inadvertently support China's military developments.
