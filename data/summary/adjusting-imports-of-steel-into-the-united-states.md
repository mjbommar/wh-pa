On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation addressing the importation of steel into the United States, citing national security concerns due to the significant increase in steel imports. The proclamation serves to reinstate stringent tariffs on imports of steel articles and derivative steel articles from countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. President Trump declared that these arrangements had previously failed to protect U.S. national security by not effectively curbing the import volumes and excess global steel capacity, thus deciding to terminate these alternative agreements and reimpose tariffs.

According to the proclamation, the Secretary of Commerce reported that prior tariffs initially increased U.S. steel production capacity utilization above 80%, which is necessary for national security. However, imports from countries under existing exemptions surged, threatening to impair U.S. domestic industry. Consequently, as of March 12, 2025, all imports will be subject to the additional tariffs originally imposed in 2018. Additionally, temporary exemptions, such as those for derivatively processed steel products and those for Ukraine, will be rescinded to prevent duty evasion and ensure national security objectives are met.

The action emphasizes the U.S. government's ongoing monitoring and adjustments based on international trading partners' responses and market behaviors. The proclamation concludes with directives for the Customs and Border Patrol to enforce the revised tariffs strictly, with no drawbacks, while continuing to revise import classifications as necessary.
