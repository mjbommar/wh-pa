On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation adjusting the import tariffs on steel articles to address national security concerns. This decision followed a report by the Secretary of Commerce, indicating that imports of steel articles, particularly from countries with whom the U.S. had reached alternative trade agreements like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, the EU, Japan, and the UK, were once again threatening U.S. national security. The proclamation reinstates an additional 25% tariff on steel imports from these countries, effective March 12, 2025, and terminates previous exemptions, including those for Ukraine.

The President's proclamation aims to mitigate the increased share of imported steel articles and to bolster the U.S. domestic steel industry, which has seen decreased capacity utilization due to surging imports. The decision also addresses issues of transshipment and data transparency with countries like Mexico and Argentina, and aims to prevent unfair competition from international subsidies or excess capacities largely exacerbated by China's steel industry practices. The document outlines specific duties and regulatory adjustments needed to ensure compliance and protect national security.

Additionally, the proclamation ends the Secretary of Commerce's authorization to issue product exclusions from these tariffs, aiming to streamline processes and prevent exclusions from undermining the tariffs' objectives. The administration has prioritized monitoring and processing these imports, with customs and other departments directed to enforce the updated tariffs rigorously.
