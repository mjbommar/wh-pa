On February 6, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). This was in response to the ICC's actions that were perceived as illegitimate and baseless against the United States and its ally, Israel. The President cited various legal authorities, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, to justify these measures. The sanctions include blocking property and assets, restricting entry into the U.S. for ICC officials and their families, and prohibiting certain financial transactions.

The Executive Order targets individuals who engage in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons from the U.S. or its allies, as defined in the order. The President declared a national emergency, stating that the ICC's actions constituted a threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy. Additionally, measures were outlined to prevent any means of evading these sanctions, ensuring the protection of U.S. military and government personnel from unjust prosecution by the ICC.

An annex to the order specifically lists Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the ICC, as a target for these sanctions. The order stresses the U.S.'s commitment to accountability and international cooperation but demands recognition of its sovereignty and the decisions to not subject its personnel to ICC jurisdiction. These actions are designed to safeguard national interests and uphold the laws of war observed by the U.S. and its allies.
