**President Donald J. Trump** has signed an **Executive Order** invoking a national emergency at the southern border of the United States as of **January 22, 2025**. This proclamation cites an ongoing immigration crisis exacerbated by four years of increasing illegal immigration numbers. The Executive Order seeks to bolster border security by deploying additional military personnel and completing the long-debated border wall. It explicitly directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to carry out these tasks efficiently and provide necessary operational flexibility to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The administration reports a staggering **8.72 million border encounters** from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, posing significant challenges to existing border resources and local communities. The order also addresses the flow of dangerous narcotics like fentanyl and the activity of gangs such as the Venezuelan **Tren de Aragua**, citing serious societal impact. It references past precedents, including Trump's 2019 national emergency declaration, to emphasize a commitment to restoring control of the border, protecting American citizens, and combating illegal networks.
