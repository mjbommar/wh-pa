On January 20, 2025, a Presidential Executive Order was issued to promote the development of Alaska's vast natural resources, including energy, minerals, timber, and seafood. The order highlights the potential economic benefits and strengthened national security that could result from full exploitation of these resources. The President plans to reverse previous administration's restrictions on resource development in Alaska, aiming to enhance the nation's energy dominance, spur economic growth, and mitigate trade imbalances.

The policy outlined in the order prioritizes the development of Alaskaâ€™s natural resources, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), and calls for expedited permitting and leasing processes. Various sections of the order instruct federal agencies, such as the Department of the Interior and Commerce, to revoke or amend regulations impeding resource development and to lift restrictions on activities within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The order also seeks to address legal deficiencies associated with previously implemented actions and emphasizes consultation with state agencies to respect cultural practices.
