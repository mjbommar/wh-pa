The **President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)** has been established by an executive order signed on January 23, 2025. The council aims to guide the United States in maintaining global technological leadership amidst rapid advances in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology. Chaired by the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI & Crypto, PCAST is composed of up to 24 members from various sectors, bringing their diverse expertise to the table.

PCAST's main purpose is to advise the President on issues related to science, technology, education, and innovation policy. The Council will engage with stakeholders across different sectors, providing insights that inform public policy and enhance America's competitive edge. Additionally, it will serve specific advisory roles under existing legislative frameworks, like the High-Performance Computing Act and the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act.

In administrating PCAST, members will serve without compensation but may have travel expenses covered. The Secretary of Energy will perform relevant functions under the Federal Advisory Committee Act as applicable. The order specifies the council's authority and its ability to form subcommittees, with a two-year term ending unless extended by the President. Furthermore, it revokes a previous Executive Order from 2021 related to an earlier version of PCAST.
