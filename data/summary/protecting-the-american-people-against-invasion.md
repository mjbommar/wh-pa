On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued focusing on bolstering enforcement against illegal immigration in the United States. The order outlines multiple actions to enforce federal immigration laws, prioritizing the removal of inadmissible aliens, especially those posing security threats. It rescinds previous executive orders from 2021 seen as easing immigration policies, emphasizing a renewed strict approach.

The order directs several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, to adopt measures such as establishing Homeland Security Task Forces nationwide, enforcing civil and criminal penalties against immigration violations, and facilitating the swift removal of illegal aliens. Additional measures include increasing detention capacities, enhancing cooperation with state and local law enforcement through agreements like the 287(g), and imposing penalties on jurisdictions not cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

Moreover, the order addresses funding to NGOs assisting undocumented immigrants, calls for a review of public benefits access for illegal aliens, and mandates the reestablishment of an office to support victims of crimes by removable aliens. This comprehensive approach aims to realign immigration-related activities of federal agencies with stricter legal interpretations and enforcement policies.
