On February 11, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed proclamations to re-establish a 25% tariff on steel imports and raise the tariff on aluminum imports to 25%, aiming to close existing loopholes and exemptions that weakened the initial tariffs. These actions, taken under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, are intended to protect national security by revitalizing the U.S. steel and aluminum industries. Past exemptions allowed certain countries to circumvent these tariffs, leading to increased import volumes and reduced domestic production. Reapplying these tariffs targets foreign nations that have flooded the U.S. market with low-cost, often government-subsidized steel and aluminum, particularly affecting domestic production due to high competition.

The original tariffs imposed by President Trump in 2018 had briefly boosted domestic production and supported the steel industryâ€™s utilization rates, but exemptions and the COVID-19 pandemic have since diminished these achievements. The revamped tariffs seek to encourage investment and production within the U.S., elevate capacity utilization, prevent further decline in domestic manufacturing, and ensure that the nation can meet demand for defense and critical infrastructure needs. Studies from various institutes highlight that these tariffs have historically strengthened the economy, reshored industries, and had minimal impact on consumer prices.
