President Donald J. Trump, on February 11, 2025, signed proclamations to restore Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. These measures were aimed at protecting the U.S. steel and aluminum industries by reinstating a 25% tariff on steel and elevating the same rate for aluminum, closing existing loopholes and exemptions. The actions were taken to combat unfair trade practices and global excess capacity, particularly targeting countries that previously enjoyed exemptions, like China.

The restoration of tariffs is part of a strategy to strengthen America's manufacturing industry by ensuring fairer competition by eliminating alternative agreements and cracking down on misclassification and duty evasion. President Trump seeks to re-achieve the program's original goal of revitalizing domestic steel and aluminum production to utilize at least 80% capacity, thus supporting national security and economic goals following weakened performances since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Studies and reports cited in the fact sheet argue that tariffs have had positive effects on the economy by increasing U.S. production, stimulating industrial reshoring, and supporting strategic manufacturing objectives without significantly affecting inflation or prices. The fact sheet aims to outline the strategic rationale behind the tariffs and strengthen market fairness for American industries.
