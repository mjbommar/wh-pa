On January 20, 2025, a Presidential Executive Order was issued to restore and enforce capital punishment in the United States, emphasizing its role in deterring serious crimes and maintaining public safety. The order seeks to counter what it describes as the subversion of capital punishment laws by previous administrations and judicial actors, particularly criticizing actions taken during President Biden's tenure. It directs the Attorney General to actively pursue the death penalty for severe crimes and to encourage state legal authorities to bring capital charges.

The order outlines specific directives for the Attorney General, including pursuing the death penalty in cases involving the murder of law enforcement officers or capital crimes committed by illegal aliens. It also mandates evaluating imprisonment conditions for those whose death sentences were commuted. Additionally, it seeks to ensure states have necessary resources for lethal injection and calls for challenging Supreme Court precedents that hinder capital punishment.

This Executive Order highlights a policy shift towards rigorous enforcement of capital punishment at both federal and state levels, advocating for stronger justice measures against violent crimes. The order underscores the government's obligation to protect its citizens and uphold laws authorizing capital punishment.
