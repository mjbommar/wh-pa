# Summary

On January 27, 2025, a presidential order was issued, emphasizing military excellence and focused readiness of the United States Armed Forces. The order outlines that the military's primary mission is to protect the American people and homeland effectively. It insists on maintaining high standards devoid of political influence, specifically targeting the inclusion of gender identity policies that conflict with traditional military health and discipline standards. The order requires that military personnel must not express a gender identity that is different from their biological sex, claiming such expression undermines the core values necessary for service.

The directive further explains that individuals with gender dysphoria or those who require specific medical interventions disrupt the core military values and readiness. To implement this, it mandates updates to existing Department of Defense instructions and introduces new guidelines aimed at ensuring uniformity and operational efficiency. Additionally, it revokes a previous executive order allowing all qualified Americans to serve, directing immediate compliance from the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security (for the Coast Guard) with these guidelines.
