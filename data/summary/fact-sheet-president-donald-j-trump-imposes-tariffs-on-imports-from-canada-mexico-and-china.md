In response to what is described as a national emergency involving illegal immigration and drug trafficking, including the influx of fentanyl, former President Donald J. Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico, and China. This decision, made public on February 1, 2025, places a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China, with a reduced 10% tariff on Canadian energy resources. These measures are intended to pressure these countries into taking stronger actions against the illegal drug trade and to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States. 

President Trump argues these tariffs are a necessary tool to safeguard national security and fulfill his election promise to seal U.S. borders. Despite previous administrations' reluctance to utilize America's economic leverage in addressing these issues, Trump aims to employ these economic strategies to prioritize domestic safety and address historically significant crises of drug addiction, particularly from substances like fentanyl. The fact sheet reiterates Trump's approach in leveraging trade policy as a component of national security and recounts previous successes regarding tariffs to support his current actions.
