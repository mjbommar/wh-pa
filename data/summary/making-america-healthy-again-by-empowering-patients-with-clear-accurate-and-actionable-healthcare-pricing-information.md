The executive order issued on February 25, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to enhance price transparency within the healthcare sector. Building on Executive Order 13877 from June 2019, this new directive mandates hospitals and health plans to provide detailed and accessible pricing information. These measures are designed to alleviate patients and employers from the undue burden of obscured healthcare costs, offering clear insights into the actual prices of medical services and prescription drugs.

The President highlights the stalled progress on these transparency efforts since his first term and critiques the subsequent administration for insufficient enforcement. The directive tasks the Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to enforce and update the transparency regulations swiftly. Actions include ensuring real price disclosures, standardizing pricing formats across hospitals, and revising enforcement policies to guarantee compliance.
