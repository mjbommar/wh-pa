On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order aimed at protecting freedom of speech by ending federal censorship. The order emphasizes the importance of the First Amendment, highlighting how the previous administration allegedly interfered with Americans' speech on online platforms by pressuring third parties like social media companies. The order criticizes past governmental actions that suppressed free speech under the pretense of addressing misinformation.

The order outlines the U.S. policy to safeguard constitutionally protected speech, prohibit federal employees from abridging it, ensure taxpayers' resources are not misused for censorship, and rectify past wrongful governmental censorship behaviors. To that end, the Attorney General is tasked with investigating past government activities over the previous four years that contravened the order's objectives, with a report and recommendations to be submitted to the President.

Finally, the order includes general provisions ensuring no impedance of legally-delegated authority, implementation based on available appropriations, and clarifying that the order does not establish any substantive rights enforceable by law.
