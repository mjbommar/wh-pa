On February 12, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order to establish a clear and unified voice for America's foreign relations. This order emphasizes the President's control over foreign policy, mandating that all personnel involved in its implementation operate under his direction. It also grants the Secretary of State the authority to revise Foreign Service procedures, including recruitment and evaluation, to ensure that only the most qualified individuals represent America abroad.

The executive order aims to align U.S. diplomacy with national interests, prioritizing America's interests in foreign policy decisions. The order strengthens accountability for personnel and procedures involved in implementing foreign policy, reinforcing the President's constitutional authority. This initiative is part of a broader effort to ensure foreign policy reflects U.S. values and enhances national security.

Building on previous initiatives such as the 'America First Policy Directive,' this order reiterates President Trump's commitment to prioritizing American interests and ensuring a strong diplomatic stance that protects sovereignty and security. The order's provisions aim to prevent foreign nations or actors from undermining U.S. sovereignty, strengthening Americaâ€™s position on the international stage.
