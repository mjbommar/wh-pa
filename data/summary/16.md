On January 20, 2025, several presidential actions were announced on the White House website. These directives aim to reform various governmental policies and practices. Key topics include reforming the federal hiring process to emphasize merit and efficiency, and ending specific diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that are perceived as radical and wasteful. Other actions focus on protecting national security and public safety, defending women's rights against gender ideology extremism, and enhancing the U.S. resource exploitation potential in Alaska.

Additional presidential directives include the establishment of a 'Department of Government Efficiency' to streamline operations, and an 'America First' foreign policy directive for the Secretary of State to prioritize U.S. interests. Actions were also taken to strengthen national security collaboration through organizational adjustments in the National Security Council and related subcommittees. An important aspect of the announcements is the United States' position on the OECD Global Tax Deal, reflecting the administration's approach to international economic cooperation.
