The webpage from the White House features a list of various official documents and actions taken in January 2025 under President Donald J. Trump’s administration. These documents include fact sheets, presidential orders, and statements that revolve around themes such as ending DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives in government agencies, particularly the Federal Aviation Administration. The goal appears to be a return to merit-based evaluations and improved safety standards. 

Among the listings are multiple presidential actions aimed at curtailing illegal discrimination, restoring merit-based federal hiring, ending perceived wasteful government DEI programs, and designating foreign terrorist organizations. Several entries feature speeches and statements, such as President Trump’s remarks at the Starlight Ball, and an OMB memo, highlighting key policy changes and intentions for the year 2025.
