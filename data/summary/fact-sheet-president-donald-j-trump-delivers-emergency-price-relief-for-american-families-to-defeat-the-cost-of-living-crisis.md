On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum aimed at addressing the cost-of-living crisis in the United States. The memorandum directs federal agencies to remove regulatory measures imposed during the Biden Administration, which are believed to have increased costs of living for American families. Key actions include lowering housing costs, reducing healthcare expenses, promoting employment, and eliminating climate policies that increase food and fuel prices.

The document criticizes the Biden Administration for contributing to inflation and increasing living expenses through regulatory burdens. It claims these policies have led to significant costs for American households, citing regulatory pressures that account for a sizeable portion of housing costs and contribute to increased energy and transportation expenses. The memorandum seeks to reverse these trends by boosting American energy independence and consumer affordability.
