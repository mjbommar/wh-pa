In a recent article for the Wall Street Journal, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins detailed a plan by the Trump Administration to address the high prices of eggs, exacerbated by repeated outbreaks of avian influenza. The strategy involves a substantial investment of $1 billion by the Agriculture Department to combat the crisis and stabilize egg prices. This effort is in response to what Rollins describes as insufficient action by the previous Biden administration in tackling the root causes of the issue.

The plan includes a collaboration between the Agriculture Department and the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce wasteful spending. By reallocating funds from these savings, the aim is to invest in long-term solutions to mitigate avian influenza outbreaks, which have led to the culling of approximately 166 million laying hens since 2022. This comprehensive strategy seeks to ensure egg affordability and address the economic impact of the influenza outbreaks.
