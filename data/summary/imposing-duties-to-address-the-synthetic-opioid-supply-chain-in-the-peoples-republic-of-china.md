On February 1, 2025, the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, issued measures to combat the synthetic opioid crisis by imposing additional import duties on products from the People's Republic of China (PRC). The President justified this action by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and other relevant U.S. laws due to the PRC's alleged role in the proliferation of synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl, into the United States. The opioid crisis has been declared a national emergency, posing significant threats to public health, national security, and the economy.

The new tariffs include a 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty on articles produced in China, effective February 4, 2025. These tariffs are part of a broader strategy to pressure the PRC to curtail the export of opioid precursors and disrupt transnational criminal organizations involved in the drug trade. Should China retaliate, the President reserves the right to increase or broaden these tariffs. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with monitoring the situation and reporting any changes in PRC's actions to the President to decide whether the tariffs should be revoked or continued.

The order emphasizes that previous actions through diplomatic channels have been insufficient and underscores that the PRC, despite having the capability to significantly reduce the illicit opioid trade, has failed to take necessary steps. As such, the action seeks not only to address the immediate crisis but also to initiate continued monitoring and potentially further actions, as may be necessary, to achieve substantial relief from the opioid epidemic.
