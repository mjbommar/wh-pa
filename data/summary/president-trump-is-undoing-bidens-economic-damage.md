President Donald J. Trump has initiated a series of measures aimed at reversing economic difficulties attributed to the Biden Administration. As of March 4, 2025, his administration has implemented plans to lower egg prices and directed executive agencies to provide emergency price relief. A National Energy Dominance Council has been established to lower energy prices, succeeding in reducing crude oil prices by over 5% since his tenure began. Additionally, Trump has halted various efficiency standard rules from the previous administration to prevent increased consumer costs on appliances. 

Trump's administration is actively seeking to cut regulatory burdens, aiming to repeal ten regulations for every new one introduced. In a bid to reduce government waste, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly saved taxpayers billions. Furthermore, Trump has dismantled the Biden-era electric vehicle mandate, adjusting CAFE standards to avoid potential income regressivity. These efforts are part of a broad strategy to lower costs for American households, which they argue had risen due to federal regulations amounting to trillions of dollars annually.
