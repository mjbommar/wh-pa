On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to dismantle the Federal Executive Institute (FEI), which was established during President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration over 50 years ago. The FEI was intended to provide leadership training for government bureaucrats, but according to President Trump, it instead contributed to a larger, inefficient federal bureaucracy that distanced itself from the needs of American citizens. The Executive Order tasks the Office of Personnel Management with executing the termination of the institute.

This decision aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to streamline the federal government by eliminating programs that are seen as wasteful or ineffective. It includes efforts such as halting foreign aid to certain organizations and establishing a "Department of Government Efficiency" tasked with evaluating and reducing bureaucratic inefficiency. Part of these efforts is Trump's 10-to-1 deregulation initiative, advocating ten regulations eliminated for every new one enacted, to ensure efficiency and benefit to the public.

Trump argued that the federal government has developed a large managerial class separated from American families' everyday concerns. By abolishing the FEI, which is based in a former luxury hotel in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump aims to redirect government resources more effectively to align with his administration's values and priorities.
