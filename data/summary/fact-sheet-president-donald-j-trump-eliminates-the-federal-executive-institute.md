**Summary**

On February 10, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to dismantle the Federal Executive Institute, an organization established over 50 years ago to provide bureaucratic leadership training to government officials. By doing so, the government aims to reduce inefficiency and bureaucracy, ensuring that taxpayer money is directed towards the needs of American families rather than maintaining a bloated managerial class. The order instructs the Office of Personnel Management to oversee the termination of the Institute and revoke its founding documents.

This initiative is part of a larger strategy by President Trump to reform the federal bureaucracy by eliminating ineffective programs and reducing wasteful expenditures. The Executive Order follows actions such as pausing foreign aid to certain organizations and creating the "Department of Government Efficiency" to streamline operations. Additionally, a 10-to-1 deregulation policy has been introduced to ensure new regulations are substantiated by clear benefits.
