On February 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum aiming to restore maximum pressure on Iran and prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. This Memorandum directs significant economic and diplomatic measures to counter Iran's nuclear ambitions and its influence abroad. The initiative includes denying Iran a nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, neutralizing its terrorist networks, and countering its development of missile and weapon capabilities. The Treasury Secretary is tasked with imposing economic sanctions and providing guidance to businesses about the risks associated with violating U.S. sanctions. Additionally, efforts will be made to drive Iran's oil exports to zero with support from international allies.

The directive also outlines steps to protect the U.S. homeland from perceived Iranian threats. The Attorney General is instructed to take legal actions against Iranian-sponsored groups operating within the United States. This includes investigating, disrupting, and prosecuting networks and individuals associated with these groups. The initiative reaffirms President Trump's commitment to not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons, emphasizing the end of tolerance for its destabilizing behavior and sponsorship of terrorism.

The actions underscore an assertive approach, aligning with the President's previous statements, to counter Iran's influence and protect global stability. This NSPM fulfills promises made in the past regarding stringent measures against Iran's activities.
