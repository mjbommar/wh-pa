President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission on February 13, 2025. The commission aims to tackle the root causes of America's escalating health crisis, focusing initially on childhood chronic diseases. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, will chair the commission. The commission is tasked with producing an assessment within 100 days on what is known and what needs to be addressed regarding childhood chronic diseases, and a strategic plan within 180 days to improve the health of American children.

The commission has outlined key policy directives to enhance public health, including promoting open-source data and transparency in health research, prioritizing research on disease causes, collaborating with farmers for healthier food, and facilitating increased treatment and coverage options for health improvements. The initiative seeks to restore trust in medical institutions through public hearings and engagements with public health leaders. President Trump emphasizes the need to address chronic illnesses, which significantly burden Americaâ€™s healthcare system, economy, and military readiness.
