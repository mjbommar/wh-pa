President Donald J. Trump signed an executive action aimed at protecting children from what he describes as 'irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation.' This initiative, dated February 3, 2025, seeks to prevent minors from undergoing procedures or receiving medications associated with changing their sex, which the administration claims are based on radical and false notions. Following this executive action, several hospitals across various states like New York, Colorado, Virginia, Washington D.C., Illinois, and Pennsylvania have started to reconsider, pause, or suspend their gender-affirming care programs for minors.

In detail, hospitals such as NYU Langone Health in New York and Denver Health in Colorado are canceling and halting appointments and surgeries for minors scheduled for gender-affirming care. Other institutions, including VCU Health and Children's Hospital of Richmond in Virginia, have suspended such services altogether. This is part of what the administration describes as a broader promise to safeguard children and uphold what they see as natural biological permanency.
