**Summary**

President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on March 1, 2025, initiating an investigation into the national security risks associated with the U.S.'s reliance on imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products like paper, furniture, and cabinetry. The Secretary of Commerce will lead this investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, assessing the economic and security vulnerabilities posed by foreign dependencies in the lumber supply chain. The ultimate goal is to determine the need for trade remedies to protect and strengthen the domestic wood products industry.

The investigation into the timber and lumber imports is based on concerns that over-dependence on these foreign goods could compromise U.S. defense capabilities and economic stability. Currently, despite its potential to produce most of its softwood needs domestically, the U.S relies heavily on imports, a situation made worse by foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices. The investigation aims to pinpoint supply chain weaknesses and propose strategies to bolster the domestic industry and enhance national security.

**Strengthening American Industry**

This initiative is part of President Trump's broader efforts to reinforce American industry through the "America First Trade Policy." Past actions have included raising tariffs on steel and aluminum, responding to China's trade practices by increasing tariffs, and launching investigations into other import threats like copper. These measures reflect a consistent policy to secure economic growth and reinforce the United States' global trade standing.
