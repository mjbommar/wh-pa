On March 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump took significant actions to enhance American energy independence. By declaring a National Energy Emergency, he aimed to unlock the country's full energy potential, reduce costs for American families, and strengthen national security. Trump's administration prioritized making the U.S. the largest net exporter of natural gas globally and established the National Energy Dominance Council to maximize the utilization of domestic energy resources.

In his efforts to promote energy dominance, President Trump reversed numerous policies from previous administrations. These changes included withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, rescinding regulations from the Biden Administration that were considered harmful to energy jobs, and halting federal permits for large wind farms. He further opened offshore drilling areas and approved new liquefied natural gas projects. By rolling back various environmental regulations, Trump's initiatives sought to foster economic growth and protect American industry interests.
