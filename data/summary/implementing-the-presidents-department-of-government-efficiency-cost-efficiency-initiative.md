# Implementing the President's Cost Efficiency Initiative

On February 26, 2025, a new executive order was issued by the President of the United States to implement the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-saving measures across federal agencies. The executive order mandates a thorough review and transformation of federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to enhance transparency and accountability. This initiative requires the creation of centralized technological systems within agencies for recording and justifying payments under federal contracts and grants.

The initiative outlines specific actions for agency heads, including pausing payments that lack written justification, reviewing existing contracts and grants to reduce or redistribute spending, and implementing approval processes for new contracts. Additional measures involve scrutinizing non-essential travel expenses and freezing credit card use for a period. A focus is placed on real property disposition, including updating inventory records and reassessing government property leases. The order sets exceptions primarily for law enforcement, military, and other critical services.
