On February 26, 2025, a presidential order was issued to enhance the efficiency of federal spending. This initiative is a part of the President's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) program, aiming to ensure transparency and accountability in federal expenditures. Each Federal agency must develop a centralized system for recording payments on contracts, grants, and loans, excluding certain areas like law enforcement and military spending. Agency heads are responsible for reviewing and possibly renegotiating existing contracts to reduce expenses.

The order outlines several specific measures to cut costs. These include requiring justifications for payments and non-essential travel, freezing agency credit card usage for 30 days, and reviewing real property to identify unnecessary government-owned real estate. Each agency must report monthly on their efforts, particularly regarding non-essential travel and contract modifications.

Certain exclusions apply, ensuring that the order does not interfere with law enforcement activities, immigration enforcement, military operations, or classified information. The order seeks to reduce wasteful spending and promote government efficiency in alignment with the President's overall policy objectives.
