President Donald J. Trump announced measures to prioritize American workers and industries by implementing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, intending to protect domestic industries from unfair foreign competition. This action was commended by several industry associations like the Steel Manufacturers Association and the Aluminum Association. Furthermore, President Trump unveiled a plan emphasizing fair and reciprocal trade to prevent the United States from being taken advantage of, which received broad approval from various industry leaders.

The administration's actions to incentivize domestic production have led to significant economic commitments. Major companies like Stellantis, Apple, and TSMC have announced substantial investments in U.S.-based manufacturing, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in total. This includes notable projects such as a $100 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing and significant expansions by companies in multiple states. These investments are aimed at creating jobs and fostering economic growth within the United States.
