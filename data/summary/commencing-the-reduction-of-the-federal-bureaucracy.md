On February 19, 2025, the President of the United States issued an order to commence the reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy. The order aims to reduce government size by eliminating non-essential functions of specific governmental entities, including the Presidio Trust, the Inter-American Foundation, the United States African Development Foundation, and the United States Institute of Peace. Heads of these entities must report on their compliance within 14 days, focusing on whether functions are statutorily required.

The order also instructs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to reject inconsistent funding requests and initiate withdrawing specific regulations to eliminate Federal Executive Boards and the Presidential Management Fellows Program. It mandates terminating several Federal Advisory Committees across various departments. Key advisers to the President must submit further recommendations for eliminating additional unnecessary governmental entities and committees.

The document emphasizes the need for the Federal Government's accountability, reduction of waste, and enhancement of American freedom. However, the order specifies that implementation must be consistent with applicable laws and existing authorities, protecting agency powers and functions granted by law.
