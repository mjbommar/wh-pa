President Donald J. Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council on February 19, 2025, as part of an initiative to reinforce American energy leadership. Led by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, this council aims to lower energy prices, align with growing demand, boost economic security, and position America as a global energy leader. This move has received support from various stakeholders, including lawmakers, industry groups, trade unions, and businesses, all of whom emphasize the council's potential to secure energy independence and enhance economic growth.

The council's creation reflects a concerted effort to dismantle regulatory hurdles and update permitting processes to encourage domestic energy production across various forms, including oil, gas, and renewables. Energy organizations, manufacturing leaders, and trade unions have expressed their optimism, highlighting the council's role in ensuring affordable supplies of energy, facilitating innovation, and creating jobs. The initiative also aims to address the challenges and demands of artificial intelligence, further backed by support from multiple organizations.

With a strong emphasis on developing a comprehensive strategy, the Council's impact is projected to reshape the national energy landscape. Lawmakers and industry leaders are hopeful that this initiative will bolster America's competitiveness, enhance its technological capabilities, and ultimately lead to a stronger, more prosperous energy sector.
