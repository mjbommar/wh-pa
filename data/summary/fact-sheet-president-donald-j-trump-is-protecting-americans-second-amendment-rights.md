President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order on February 7, 2025, aimed at halting federal actions that allegedly violate the Second Amendment rights of Americans. This action mandates a review by the Attorney General of existing policies from the Biden Administration concerning firearms and to propose a plan to eliminate any infringements. The Executive Order addresses policies that limit the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms for self-defense and protection.

The Executive Order criticizes previous enforcement strategies employed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), which led to an increase in actions against Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), including small businesses. The Trump Administration claims these policies were an unwarranted attack on citizens' constitutional rights. Actions include the removal of U.S. participation from the UN Arms Trade Treaty and the designation of the firearms industry as essential during the pandemic.

The significance of this order lies in its intention to reinforce the protection of gun rights and limit federal regulatory actions affecting firearms manufacturers and sellers. By emphasizing constitutional rights, President Trump's administration aims to ensure the availability and use of firearms for self-defense purposes by legal gun owners.
