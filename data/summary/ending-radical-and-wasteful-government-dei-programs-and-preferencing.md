On January 20, 2025, a presidential order was issued to terminate all diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI and DEIA) programs within the U.S. Federal Government. This order aims to reverse the initiatives started under Executive Order 13985 by the Biden Administration, which mandated agencies to submit Equity Action Plans involving DEI measures. The President's directive stresses the reallocation of resources towards programs promoting individual merit without considering DEI factors.

The order tasks the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, along with the Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to spearhead the dismantling of these programs. Each federal agency is instructed to identify DEI-related roles, programs, and activities by a set deadline, and terminate them to the extent legally possible. A monthly meeting will be held to evaluate the orderâ€™s implementation, addressing any barriers or areas requiring further presidential or legislative action.

The order also contains provisions ensuring its alignment with existing laws and appropriations and states that it should not create enforceable rights against the United States. Its severability clause ensures that any invalid portion does not affect the remainder of the order's provisions.
