On January 20, 2025, the President issued an executive order to rescind various executive actions from the previous administration. This order aims to eliminate what is seen as harmful practices involving diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, border policies, and climate regulations. The order emphasizes restoring common sense to the Federal Government and prioritizing economic growth and unity for the American people.

The order specifies a list of executive orders, memoranda, and proclamations from January 20, 2021, to January 20, 2025, slated for revocation. These cover areas like racial equity, COVID-19 response, environmental regulations, immigration, and healthcare, among others. Additionally, the agency heads have been instructed to cease implementing DEI ideologies, and further review panels will assess more actions from the former administration to recommend their rescission.

Implementation provisions are laid out, instructing review and action from various parts of the government, including the Domestic Policy Council and National Security Advisor, to identify and recommend further steps. The order also contains general provisions to ensure the revocations comply with existing laws and budgets, aiming to execute these changes in a lawful and efficient manner.
