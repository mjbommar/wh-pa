### Summary

On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. This action, citing the National Emergencies Act and other statutory authorities, prioritizes the expansion and enhancement of the country's energy infrastructure. The order identifies numerous problem areas, including inadequate energy production and infrastructure, high energy prices, and the threat from hostile foreign actors. The President emphasizes that addressing these issues is critical to maintaining national security and economic stability, and positions U.S. energy resources as a tool for international diplomacy and economic growth.

Federal agencies are tasked with identifying and utilizing all lawful emergency powers to enhance domestic energy production, transportation, refining, and generation. This includes potential actions involving eminent domain or the Defense Production Act. The Environmental Protection Agency is also directed to consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to address gasoline shortages. Furthermore, strategies under the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and consultation processes are to be expedited to support these energy directives. The Department of Defense is instructed to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities and propose solutions to safeguard national defense capabilities.

The order sets reporting obligations for various Secretaries to keep the President and relevant council members informed of developments. Additionally, it aims to foster interagency collaboration to overcome regulatory and infrastructure barriers.
