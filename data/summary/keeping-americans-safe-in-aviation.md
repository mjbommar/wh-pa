On January 21, 2025, a presidential action was announced to address hiring practices at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The document criticizes the prior administration for prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies over merit, particularly in the hiring and promotion processes within FAA roles that are critical to aviation safety. The current administration mandates a return to strict, merit-based hiring and promotion standards, focusing on individual capability and excellence over demographics or personal characteristics.

The action requires the Secretary of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administrator to rescind all DEI initiatives and review the performance of current employees in critical safety positions to ensure they meet the highest standards. The goal is to prioritize safety and operational efficiency by ensuring all FAA employees are selected based solely on their qualifications and ability to perform essential duties competently, without any influence from discriminatory practice.
