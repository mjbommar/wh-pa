On January 20, 2025, the President signed an Executive Order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (named **DOGE**) as part of efforts to modernize federal technology and enhance governmental efficiency. This initiative, known as the DOGE Agenda, aims to improve the productivity of federal agencies by upgrading software and technology infrastructure. The order mandates the reorganization and renaming of the United States Digital Service to the United States DOGE Service (USDS), which will operate within the Executive Office of the President.

The order details the structure of the USDS, including the appointment of a USDS Administrator who will oversee a temporary organization dedicated to advancing the DOGE agenda over an 18-month period, concluding on July 4, 2026. Each federal agency shall form a DOGE Team comprised of personnel such as engineers and human resources specialists to work collaboratively with the USDS Administrator. These teams are tasked with ensuring data integrity, fostering interoperability between agency systems, and adhering to stringent data protection guidelines.

The order authorizes the displacement of previous executive orders and regulations that might restrict USDS's access to agency data and systems. It specifies that its implementation should not interfere with existing legal authorities of executive departments and must be executed within the confines of available appropriations. Furthermore, the order clarifies that it does not confer legal rights enforceable by individuals against the government.
