On March 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump initiated several measures aimed at reducing the size and inefficiencies of the federal government. This effort included the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to enhance productivity and cut unnecessary spending. Significant actions taken by President Trump included ordering federal employees to return to the office five times a week, restricting new hires to a ratio of one for every four departures, and terminating contracts with 'Fake News' media. Additionally, funding reviews were directed for non-governmental organizations, identifying grants worth $60 billion that could potentially be eliminated.

Among other actions, President Trump targeted specific agencies for reform, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, which launched investigations into mismanagement, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose operations were halted. Foreign aid grants paused at the Department of State and the cessation of the 'Climate Corps' program marked key decisions to ensure fiscal accountability. Efforts extended to reversing IRS expansions from the previous administration and lifting collective bargaining agreements meant to deter efficient institutional restructuring.
