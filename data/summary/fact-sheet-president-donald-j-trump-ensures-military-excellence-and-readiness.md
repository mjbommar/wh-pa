**President Donald J. Trump** signed an **Executive Order** on January 27, 2025, to update the Department of Defense's guidance regarding medical standards for trans-identifying service members. This order aims to prioritize military readiness and lethality by rescinding previous guidance deemed inconsistent. The order mandates the Secretary of Defense to cease the use of identification-based pronouns and prohibits males from using female-designated facilities. It also revokes Executive Order 14004 from the Biden Administration, which advocated for accommodating gender identity in the military.

The Executive Order reflects a shift in military policy from the previous administration by emphasizing physical and mental fitness standards. It criticizes the Department of Defense's previous policies for failing to maintain cohesion and preparedness within the military ranks, citing financial and operational strains attributed to accommodating individuals transitioning gender. This action aligns with President Trump's focus on maintaining a militarily effective force capable of deploying quickly and meeting the physical challenges necessary for combat.
