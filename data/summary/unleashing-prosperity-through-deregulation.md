On January 31, 2025, an executive order was issued by the President of the United States aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and promoting economic prosperity. The order outlines a strategy where for every new regulation implemented, at least ten existing ones must be identified for removal. This policy is intended to simplify federal regulations that often impose significant costs and barriers to economic growth and innovation.

To ensure financial and regulatory prudence, agencies are directed to manage their regulatory budgets by minimizing the incremental costs associated with new regulations. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is tasked with providing guidance on measuring regulatory costs, as well as overseeing the implementation and compliance of the regulation cap and incremental cost reduction strategies.

The order exempts regulations related to national security, military, and immigration functions, among others. The regulatory cap for fiscal year 2025 mandates that the total incremental cost of new and repealed regulations should be significantly less than zero. This is to promote transparency and ensure that regulations are in alignment with executive and legislative priorities.
