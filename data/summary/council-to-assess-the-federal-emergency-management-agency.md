### Summary

On January 24, 2025, a Presidential order was issued to establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council. This Council is tasked with conducting a comprehensive review of FEMA's performance, with particular emphasis on its responsiveness, impartiality, and focus during disasters. The order arises from criticisms of FEMA's handling of disaster relief efforts and alleged political bias, particularly concerning the response to Hurricane Helene and other emergencies.

The Council, led by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense, along with up to 20 members from both federal and non-federal backgrounds, will evaluate FEMA's procedures and policies. They aim to provide recommendations for structural changes to improve FEMA's effectiveness, focusing on its relationship with state and local agencies and its ability to supplement rather than replace state-level disaster management. The Council is expected to produce a detailed report within 180 days of its first meeting, which will occur within 90 days of the order.

The administration of the Council includes collecting and analyzing data from various stakeholders and forming subcommittees as necessary. The Department of Homeland Security will support the Council's operations. Additionally, the order stipulates that the Council will operate for one year unless extended by the President, with its undertakings bound by existing laws and budgetary constraints.
