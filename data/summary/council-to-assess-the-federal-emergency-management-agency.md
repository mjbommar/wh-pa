The Council to Assess the Federal Emergency Management Agency was established on January 26, 2025, by Presidential order to review and enhance FEMA's efficiency and competency in disaster response. The Council, composed of up to 20 members, includes the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense as co-chairs. It aims to evaluate FEMA's past performance and recommend improvements to ensure an impartial and effective federal disaster response. The Council will solicit input from various stakeholders and produce a comprehensive report assessing FEMA's disaster response adequacy.

The Council's objectives include advising the President on FEMA's capacity to address national disasters, comparing FEMA's responses to those of other sectors, and recommending improvements or reforms. Public opinions and expert views will be considered during the review process. The Council's findings will be presented in a report to the President within 180 days of its first public meeting. The order mandates collaboration between executive departments and permits the creation of subcommittees to aid the process, with funding and support provided by the Department of Homeland Security.
