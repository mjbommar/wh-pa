### Summary
On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The decision was based on perceived failures by the WHO in handling health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, alleged inadequacies in reforms, and perceived undue financial burdens placed on the United States compared to other nations. Additional reasons include the WHO's inability to separate from political influences within its member states.

The executive order mandates several actions, including revoking a prior directive that reversed the initial withdrawal notice, pausing U.S. contributions to the WHO, and identifying new partners to take over the public health activities previously administered by the WHO. The Secretary of State is instructed to halt negotiations concerning WHO agreements and amendments while informing relevant international bodies about the withdrawal. The order is to be executed in accordance with existing laws and financial appropriations.
