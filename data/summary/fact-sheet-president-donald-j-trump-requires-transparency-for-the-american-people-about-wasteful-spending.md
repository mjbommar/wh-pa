President Donald J. Trump signed a memorandum on February 18, 2025, aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in federal spending. This action mandates federal departments and agencies to disclose information regarding wasteful expenditures in terminated programs, canceled contracts, and discontinued grants. The initiative emphasizes the right of the American people to understand how their tax money is used and aims to eliminate expenditure on programs that do not serve the nation's interest.

The memorandum highlights specific examples of wasteful spending from the previous Biden Administration, such as funding for electric vehicle charging stations and environmental justice grants that Trump labeled as unnecessary or ideologically driven. It also reviews funds labeled ‘misplaced’ and reclaims billions in taxpayer funds. To further these efforts, President Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to ensure that government spending is efficient and effective, and to eliminate waste.

This action is part of President Trump's broader effort to reform government by reducing regulatory burdens and targeting perceived inefficiencies within government spending practices. The aim is to cut down on what he views as politically-motivated projects that do not align with national interests, thereby restoring power and reducing financial waste.
