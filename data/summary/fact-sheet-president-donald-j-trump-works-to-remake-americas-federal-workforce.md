On February 11, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to reform the federal workforce via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. This initiative aims to make the federal workforce smaller and more effective by coordinating with agency heads to limit hiring to essential positions and reducing the workforce size. Certain critical functions and personnel related to national security and public safety are exempt from these reductions. The Office of Personnel Management is tasked with introducing regulations to uphold high conduct standards among federal employees.

The Executive Order includes measures to significantly reduce the federal government footprint by controlling spending and debt associated with federal employees. Trump aims to shrink federal employment numbers, noting over 2.4 million employees outside of active-duty military and postal workers. A hiring plan proposes allowing only one hire for every four employees departing, excluding vital roles. This approach is driven by the belief that reducing the number of federal agencies, currently over 400 according to the Federal Register, is crucial.

President Trump continues to prioritize workforce reform as part of his second-term agenda, building on economic growth and innovation strategies from his first term. The focus remains on minimizing administrative overhead and the unnecessary expansion of federal responsibilities, showcasing Trump's ongoing commitment to streamline government operations.
