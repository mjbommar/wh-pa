On February 7, 2025, a new presidential order was issued to protect the Second Amendment rights of American citizens. The President directed the Attorney General to review all executive actions from January 2021 to January 2025 that may have infringed upon these rights, focusing on actions purporting to promote safety and regulations regarding firearms and firearms licensees. This comprehensive review includes examining rules promulgated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and agency actions around regulatory enforcement policies on firearms.

The order requires the Attorney General to present a proposed plan of action to the President within 30 days to ensure Second Amendment rights are upheld. This plan must also consider litigation positions, firearm classifications, and the processing of firearm-related applications. Upon submission, the Attorney General will work with the Domestic Policy Advisor to finalize and implement this plan, ensuring it aligns with applicable laws and budgetary constraints.

The order emphasizes its alignment with existing laws and assures it does not create new enforceable rights against the U.S. government. It underscores the Second Amendment as fundamental to American liberty and aims to correct or prevent any potential unconstitutional actions identified in the review process.
