On January 20, 2025, the President of the United States issued a proclamation aimed at addressing the outcomes of criminal cases related to the events at or near the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Exercising authority granted by the Constitution, Article II, Section 2, the President commuted the sentences of 14 individuals to time served and granted a full pardon to all others convicted of offenses connected to that day.

The proclamation highlighted a goal of ending what was described as a 'grave national injustice' and emphasized national reconciliation. It instructed the Attorney General to facilitate the issuance of pardon certificates and immediate release of affected prisoners. Additionally, it called for dismissing ongoing indictments tied to the Capitol events, directing the Bureau of Prisons to comply with these instructions promptly.
