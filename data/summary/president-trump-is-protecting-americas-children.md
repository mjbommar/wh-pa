President Donald J. Trump has taken several actions to reverse policies from the Biden Administration, focusing on policies related to gender, young people, and health. Key measures include establishing a policy that recognizes only two sexes and putting an end to what he describes as the unfair practice of women competing against men in sports. Additionally, this led to a change in NCAA rules and investigations into certain athletic associations in California and Minnesota.

Trump's administration has also influenced health systems across the country to halt or reduce programs related to sex change treatments for minors, initiated following his executive order titled 'Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation'. Health organizations in states such as Illinois, Colorado, Washington D.C., and Virginia have paused or suspended these services. Furthermore, Trump banned COVID-19 vaccine mandates at federally funded schools and aimed to end the promotion of radical 'gender ideology' and 'equity ideology', emphasizing parental rights.
