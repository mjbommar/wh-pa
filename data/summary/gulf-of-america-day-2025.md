On February 9, 2025, President Donald J. Trump officially proclaimed the first Gulf of America Day. This proclamation follows the signing of Executive Order 14172 on January 20, 2025, which directed the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The renaming affects the U.S. Continental Shelf area neighboring Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, extending to Mexico and Cuba, as part of an effort to honor and restore American greatness in this historically significant region. 

The President cited the significance of this region as a key asset in America's growth and history, reaffirming the administration's aim to strengthen national pride and commemorate this change. The proclamation calls upon public officials and citizens to engage in appropriate observances such as programs and activities, thereby making this renaming and its celebration a formal part of the nation's calendar.
