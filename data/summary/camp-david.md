Camp David, formally known as the Naval Support Facility Thurmont, serves as the President's country residence and is situated in Catoctin Mountain Park, Frederick County, Maryland. Originally established by President Franklin Roosevelt, the residence was named USS Shangri La and modeled after Roosevelt's winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. Later, President Eisenhower renamed it in honor of his grandson, David.

Camp David has been significant in hosting foreign dignitaries and facilitating diplomatic discussions. The first known such meeting occurred in May of 1943 with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. A crucial diplomatic event, the Camp David Accords, stemmed from the 1978 summit held here involving Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
