# Establishment of The White House Faith Office

On February 7, 2025, a Presidential action was established to create the White House Faith Office to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship. This initiative seeks to enhance these groups' ability to serve families and communities by providing them with equal opportunities to participate in federal grant and funding programs. The aim is to leverage these organizations' unique capabilities to strengthen families, uplift individuals through employment and self-sufficiency, protect religious freedom, and address local problems effectively.

The order amends several previous executive orders to rename existing faith-based initiatives under the new White House Faith Office and Centers for Faith. The office's responsibilities include advising on policy, coordinating federal efforts, and ensuring the protection of religious liberties. It outlines the creation of a supportive network across federal agencies to align with the White House's goals, ensuring full participation of faith-based organizations in government programs.

Key roles within the White House Faith Office include consulting with experts, recommending policy changes, and showcasing innovative community programs. It plans to work collaboratively with various agencies to provide training and identify grants for organizations inexperienced with public funding. Additionally, the order is positioned to empower these faith-based entities by reducing barriers to their participation in federal programs and safeguarding their religious freedoms.
