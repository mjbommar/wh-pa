The document is a Presidential Memorandum dated January 20, 2025, addressed to the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior. It directs these officials, along with other relevant departments and agencies such as the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to resume efforts to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California. This water routing initiative is aimed at providing a stable water supply to this region, as opposed to the current situation where significant amounts of water flow into the Pacific Ocean, allegedly for the protection of certain fish species.

During the President's first term, similar efforts were halted due to a lawsuit from the State of California, citing environmental concerns for the Delta smelt and other fish species. The memorandum emphasizes the necessity of providing a reliable water supply to combat the destructive wildfires in Southern California. The President mandates a progress report within 90 days regarding the implementation of this directive and suggestions for its future execution.
