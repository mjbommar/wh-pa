The document is a Presidential order issued on February 15, 2025, addressing the discontinuation of COVID-19 vaccine mandates in educational institutions. The President, drawing powers from the Constitution and applicable laws, mandates that Federal funds should not support educational agencies that require COVID-19 vaccination for attendance. The order emphasizes the low risk of serious illness from COVID-19 for children and young adults, arguing that mandates infringe on personal freedom, parental authority, and may pose burdens upon specific faiths.

The order directs the Secretary of Education to issue guidelines to various educational bodies regarding legal obligations pertaining to parental authority, religious freedom, and equal protection concerning COVID-19 school mandates. Within 90 days, a plan must be furnished to end coercive mandates, detailing non-compliant entities and processes to prevent or retract Federal funding from them. The order reinforces its compatibility with existing laws, clarifies it doesn't impair authoritative functions of other entities, and states it won't create legally enforceable rights.
