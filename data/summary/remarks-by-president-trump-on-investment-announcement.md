On March 3, 2025, President Trump announced a significant investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in the United States during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. TSMC, led by C.C. Wei, plans to invest a minimum of $100 billion to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Arizona, creating thousands of high-paying jobs. This investment aims to boost the production of advanced AI chips in the U.S., enhancing national security and economic dominance in semiconductor manufacturing.

The announcement included remarks from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who both lauded the investment as a testament to President Trump's economic policies. The TSMC investment will significantly increase the percentage of semiconductor manufacturing within the U.S., addressing concerns over national security due to Taiwan's monopoly on chip manufacturing. The press conference also discussed broader economic impacts, including tariffs and trade relations with countries like Canada, Mexico, and China.

In addition to the TSMC announcement, President Trump highlighted other significant investments, such as Apple's $500 billion commitment to U.S. manufacturing. He emphasized the importance of having a domestic supply of semiconductors for both economic and national security, and reiterated his administration's focus on bolstering domestic manufacturing through various incentives and tariffs.
