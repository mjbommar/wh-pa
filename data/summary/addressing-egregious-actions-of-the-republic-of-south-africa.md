### Summary

On February 7, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order in response to actions taken by the Republic of South Africa. The order, part of the Presidentâ€™s powers under the US Constitution and related laws, addresses the Expropriation Act 13 of 2024 enacted by South Africa. This Act permits the seizure of agricultural properties from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation. The US government views this move as part of a series of discriminatory policies and actions that undermine citizens' rights and contribute to racial violence. Additionally, South Africa's international stance, including its accusations against US ally Israel at the International Court of Justice and strengthening relations with Iran, have been highlighted as issues of concern for US foreign policy and security.

As a result, the United States has resolved to implement policies withholding aid or assistance to South Africa as long as such practices continue. The US will also promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees who face government-sponsored discrimination. The directive calls for the cessation of foreign aid by all executive departments and outlines provisions for humanitarian support and resettlement opportunities for affected individuals. The order specifies that these steps should be carried out within legal constraints and resource availability, without creating enforceable legal rights for individuals.
