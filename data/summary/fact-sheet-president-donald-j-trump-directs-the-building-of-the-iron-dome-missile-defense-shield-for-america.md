On January 27, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to begin the construction of an advanced missile defense system known as the Iron Dome for America. This executive directive focuses on shielding the United States from ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missile threats. The initiative aims to advance the nation's defense capabilities by developing and deploying various space-based and missile interception technologies and ensuring the security of supply chains for all components of the system. The plan includes modernizing current defense systems and enhancing cooperation with global allies in missile defense.

The Executive Order also mandates a review of the US theater missile defense posture for American troops stationed abroad and seeks to enhance coordination with international partners in missile defense technology and operations. This effort addresses the growing complexity and threat posed by next-generation strategic weapons and aims to provide the US with a credible deterrent capability. This action is framed as a move to strengthen national security and fulfill the promise of building the Iron Dome locally within the United States.
