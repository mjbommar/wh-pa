On January 27, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to initiate the construction of an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield for the United States. This initiative aims to protect the nation from ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missile attacks. The Executive Order mandates the quick development and deployment of comprehensive defenses, including space-based sensors and interceptors, non-kinetic defense capabilities, and measures to secure supply chains. The plan also involves reviewing missile defense strategies abroad and enhancing collaboration with international partners.

The project addresses the growing threat from next-generation strategic weapons and aims to modernize outdated defense systems that have traditionally focused on rogue nations or accidental threats. By establishing a robust missile defense shield, it seeks to empower the United States with enhanced deterrence capabilities, reinforcing the strategy of peace through strength that President Trump advocated for. The development is also set to occur domestically, aligning with Trump's promises of American-made military advancements.
