The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on January 20, 2025, titled 'Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.' It addresses the interpretation of birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that people born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. This order specifies that certain individuals born in the U.S. are not automatically granted citizenship, particularly when the criteria concerning the legal and residency status of their parents are unmet. 

Specifically, it limits citizenship for those born to parents where the mother is either unlawfully present or there temporarily, and neither parent is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The document sets guidelines and policies for government departments not to issue citizenship documents to individuals fitting these criteria, applies 30 days post-order, and ensures existing processes for others, like lawful permanent residents' children, are unaffected. Agencies such as the State Department, Justice Department, Homeland Security, and Social Security are tasked with enforcing these measures.

Furthermore, all executive departments and agencies have to provide guidance within 30 days for implementing this order. Definitions are provided for terms like 'Mother' and 'Father,' and provisions stipulate that the order does not alter existing authorities or create enforceable legal rights. The document underscores its alignment with legal and budgetary regulations.
