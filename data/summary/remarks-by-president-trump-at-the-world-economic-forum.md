On January 23, 2025, President Trump delivered remarks at the World Economic Forum via teleconference from the White House. During his speech, President Trump asserted the start of a new era in America following his recent electoral victory, which he described as historic and characterized by a wide margin of votes across all seven swing states. He criticized the previous administration's handling of the U.S. economy, citing excessive government spending and restrictive regulations as contributors to inflation and high interest rates. To address these issues, he outlined various initiatives taken in the early days of his new administration, such as reversing regulations, freezing government hiring, and establishing a Department of Government Efficiency.

The President addressed questions from business leaders regarding regulatory policies, energy production, and international trade. He promised to continue working towards reducing wasteful spending and emphasized restoring merit-based policies and sovereignty at the national border. Trump concluded with a hopeful outlook on international cooperation and the prospects of denuclearization and peace settlement efforts involving key players like President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia.
