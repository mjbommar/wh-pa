On January 20, 2025, a directive was issued to the heads of all departments and agencies within the executive branch of the U.S. Government. This memorandum mandates that remote work arrangements be terminated, urging employees to return to their official duty stations for in-person work full-time. While executing this directive, department and agency heads are advised to implement necessary exemptions, ensuring compliance is consistent with applicable laws.

The primary aim of this memorandum appears to be to restore normalcy and productivity levels by having government employees fully present at their work sites. Agency leaders are given discretion to make exemptions as necessary, likely recognizing the challenges and diverse needs across different departments. The implementation is expected to take place as soon as practicable, acknowledging logistical considerations.
