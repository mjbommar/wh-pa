The document, dated February 3, 2025, details presidential actions taken by the President of the United States to address the situation at the southern border, particularly concerning Mexico's role. The President determined that Mexico's failure to effectively combat drug trafficking and illegal migration constitutes a severe threat to the U.S. As a response, tariffs on Mexican imports were imposed, invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and other statutory authorities.

In recognition of immediate steps taken by Mexico to address these issues, the additional tariffs were paused until March 4, 2025, to allow further assessment of the situation. This order specifies that if the situation deteriorates or if Mexico does not take adequate actions, the tariffs will be implemented without delay. The document outlines consultations among various U.S. departments and officials to continuously evaluate the situation, ensuring that efforts are aligned with U.S. laws and available resources.
