On February 11, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation adjusting the tariffs on aluminum imports into the United States. Initially, a 10% ad valorem tariff was imposed on aluminum imports as per Proclamation 9704 in 2018, aimed at mitigating threats to national security. However, despite these measures, imports continued to surge due to global overcapacity, mostly driven by Chinese production and investments in other countries, including Mexico. The situation was further complicated as foreign producers circumvented tariffs using transshipment, processing, and exploiting loopholes. 

In response to ongoing challenges and the failure to achieve a domestic smelter capacity utilization goal of 80%, the President decided to increase the tariff to 25% and terminate alternative trade agreements with countries such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and the UK. The new tariff includes additional derivative aluminum articles, although products manufactured from U.S.-sourced aluminum will be exempt. To ensure these measures are effective, the Secretary of Commerce, along with other governmental bodies, will monitor imports closely. This proclamation aims to strengthen the national security of the United States by more robustly controlling aluminum import levels.
