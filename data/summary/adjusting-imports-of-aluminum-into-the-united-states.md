# Summary

On February 11, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation to adjust tariffs on aluminum imports into the United States. The decision followed recommendations from the Secretary of Commerce, indicating that current tariffs and exclusions were insufficient in protecting national security and the U.S. aluminum industry. Beginning March 12, 2025, tariffs on aluminum imports will increase from 10% to 25% for most countries, with existing exemption agreements with countries like Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and the United Kingdom being terminated.

The proclamation outlines increasing aluminum import volumes despite previous tariffs and highlights actions to prevent tariff circumvention, such as curbing product exclusions and addressing transshipment and loophole issues. It emphasizes the need to protect domestic producers and align import levels with national security objectives set in earlier reports. Further regulations, monitoring, and adjustments are authorized to ensure effective enforcement and support the domestic aluminum industry's capacity utilization growth.
