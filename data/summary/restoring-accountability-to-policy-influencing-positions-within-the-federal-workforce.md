The document outlines a Presidential Executive Order issued on January 20, 2025, focused on reinstating and amending past federal workforce policies to restore accountability to policy-influencing positions in the federal civil service. The order highlights the President's constitutional authority to manage the executive branch effectively and emphasizes the need for accountability among federal employees, specifically those influencing policy, due to previously recorded instances of insubordination and resistance to executive directives.

The order reinstates and amends Executive Order 13957, originally established under a prior administration in 2020, which created Schedule F positions within the excepted service. These changes aim to enhance accountability by redefining the categorization of these positions to 'Schedule Policy/Career' and adjusting associated responsibilities and procedures. Furthermore, the order directs revisions of existing civil service regulations and revokes Executive Order 14003, which formerly protected the Federal Workforce, thereby altering current workforce management practices.

Additional directives are included for the Office of Personnel Management to identify more positions for inclusion under Schedule Policy/Career and to revise regulations that could hinder effective implementation of this order. The intention is to ensure that employees in these influential roles are required to implement, though not necessarily support, current administration policies, with non-compliance potentially leading to dismissal.
