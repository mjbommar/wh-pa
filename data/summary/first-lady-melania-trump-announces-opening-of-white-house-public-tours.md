First Lady Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House for public tours on February 25, 2025. This initiative is intended to educate the public about the White House's history, including the American Presidency and the First Families who have lived there. Public tours provide a unique opportunity to experience this historic landmark firsthand. 

Tours must be requested through Members of Congress and are scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis. They are self-guided, lasting approximately 45 minutes, and are generally available from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Tuesday through Thursday, and from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Friday through Saturday, excluding federal holidays. The official White House schedule may allow for extended tour hours. For more details, visitors can refer to the White House's official website.
