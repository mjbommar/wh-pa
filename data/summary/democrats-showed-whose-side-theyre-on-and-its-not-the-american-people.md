On March 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump addressed a joint session of Congress with a speech highlighting the achievements made in his second term and establishing a roadmap for future prosperity and strength. However, Congressional Democrats are criticized for not supporting or applauding various initiatives and accomplishments mentioned by the President. These included efforts such as capturing an ISIS terrorist, lowering taxes for the middle class, encouraging military enlistment, upholding law and order, promoting free speech, and ending certain policies and mandates.

The Democrats' lack of response was characterized as being driven by disdain for the President, which prevented them from showing approval for initiatives beneficial to the American people. The speech covered a wide array of topics, such as economic growth, energy independence, immigration enforcement, criminal justice, and youth protection. Dana Perino was quoted, describing the Democrat Party as lacking common sense, ideas, and empathy, unable to appreciate uplifting parts of the speech.
