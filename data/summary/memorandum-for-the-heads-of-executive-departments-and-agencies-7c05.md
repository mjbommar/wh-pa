On February 18, 2025, a memorandum titled **Radical Transparency About Wasteful Spending** was issued to the heads of executive departments and agencies. The document emphasizes the need to eliminate federal spending on programs, contracts, and grants that do not serve the interests of the American people. It highlights concerns over taxpayer money being used for ideological projects and endeavors that do not align with national objectives.

The President has instructed agency leaders to act diligently in making public the complete details of any programs, contracts, grants, or other obligations of federal funds that have been terminated or discontinued. The goal is to provide transparency in federal spending, ensuring that the publication of such data complies with all applicable laws and regulations. This approach aims to clearly show taxpayers how their money is spent and to ensure that federal resources advance the country's interests.
