On February 20, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, along with other key administration figures, delivered a press briefing to highlight key achievements in President Trump's second term. The briefing reviewed accomplishments including the signing of 73 executive orders meant to reduce regulations, revitalize energy policies, and reinforce national security through measures such as sealing the border and renaming significant landmarks. Prominent attendees included Stephen Miller, Kevin Hassett, and Mike Waltz, who emphasized actions taken across policy areas like border security, economic reforms, and international relations.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller highlighted the administration's drastic reduction in illegal immigration and the reclassification of certain foreign groups as terrorist organizations. Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett focused on economic strategies to combat inflation by reducing government spending and increasing trade reciprocity. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz discussed diplomatic efforts aimed at negotiating peace in global conflicts, notably between Russia and Ukraine, while reasserting alliances with world leaders. The session also addressed plans for a newly formed government efficiency department to tackle waste and enhance productivity in federal agencies, drawing in stakeholders like Elon Musk for consultation on technological improvements.
