On February 19, 2025, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order to enhance lawful governance and implement a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) deregulation initiative. This order mandates executive agencies to review existing regulations to ensure they are constitutionally authorized and aligned with Administration policy. The primary goal is to reduce regulatory burdens that hinder economic activities and technological advancement.

The order outlines specific areas where regulations should be rescinded or modified, including those lacking clear statutory authority or imposing economic costs without corresponding public benefits. Agency heads are tasked with identifying regulations that fall within these categories and working with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to develop a Unified Regulatory Agenda to address these issues.

Additionally, the Executive Order emphasizes the de-prioritization of enforcing regulations that exceed constitutional powers and mandates consultations for new regulations with relevant team leads and departments. Certain areas like national security and immigration remain exempt from these directives, and the order clarifies that it does not impede existing legal authorities or create enforceable rights for individuals.
