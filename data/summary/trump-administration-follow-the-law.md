The Trump administration, as of February 13, 2025, has taken decisive actions to enforce federal laws across several domains. The Department of Education has started investigations into certain educational bodies in California and Minnesota for non-compliance with an executive order protecting girls in sports, as well as probing anti-Semitic incidents in universities. The Department of Justice is actively suing states like New York and cities like Chicago for not adhering to federal immigration laws and policies.

In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has involved the DOJ regarding hidden funds allegedly mishandled by outgoing staffers from the previous administration. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is investigating DEI policies at Comcast and has taken steps against certain radio stations for broadcasting sensitive information and potential federal law violations. Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security is recovering funds from FEMA officials who allegedly misused them to accommodate illegal immigrants in luxury hotels.

Overall, the administration is emphasizing strict adherence to federal laws and taking legal actions against states and entities that conspire against or defy these laws. These moves target a range of issues from sports and discrimination policies to immigration and financial accountability.
