On February 14, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to prohibit federal funding from supporting schools that enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates. This order affects educational service agencies, state and local education agencies, elementary, secondary, and higher education institutions. The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services are tasked with issuing compliance guidelines and reporting non-compliant entities.

President Trump emphasizes protecting personal freedoms and opposes what he perceives as government overreach through COVID-19 vaccine mandates in educational settings. He argues that these mandates pressure students into decisions that should be based on personal choice rather than government influence. The order reflects Trump's commitment to ensuring educational opportunities are not jeopardized by medical requirements, fulfilling a campaign promise to prevent vaccine mandates in schools.
