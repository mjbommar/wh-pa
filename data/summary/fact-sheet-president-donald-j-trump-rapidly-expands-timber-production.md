On March 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at increasing domestic timber production and improving forest management. The order seeks to streamline federal policies, reduce wildfire risks, and decrease the United States' reliance on imported timber. Key measures include cutting regulatory red tape, boosting timber sales from public lands, and expediting approvals under the Endangered Species Act to prevent delays in forestry projects. The initiative is part of President Trump's broader goal to create jobs, reduce construction costs, and make the United States more self-reliant in various industrial sectors.

The Executive Order emphasizes the strategic importance of the wood industry to national security and economic stability, noting that a robust domestic timber industry could meet most of the country's needs and reduce foreign dependency. It also supports over 750,000 jobs and is integral to the U.S. manufacturing and defense sectors. This directive builds on Trump's previous efforts to improve forest management and address wildfire risks, highlighting the connection between proper forest management and the safety of American communities, as evidenced by recent wildfires in California.
