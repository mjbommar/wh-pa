On February 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at preserving single-sex sports by restricting the participation of men in women's sports. This action is intended to uphold the principles of Title IX, which promises equal opportunities for women and girls. The order directs the Department of Justice to cease any actions related to the previous administration's Title IX changes, mandates state attorneys general to devise best practices for equality in sports, and seeks to influence international organizations like the International Olympic Committee. Furthermore, the order emphasizes having organizations listen to female athletes affected by current policies.

The Executive Order is a response to what the Trump administration sees as overreach by the previous Biden Administration, which had issued rulings altering the definition of 'woman' under Title IX to include gender identity. This approach was heavily criticized for undermining women's rights in various fields, including sports. President Trump criticized these previous policies for negatively impacting the privacy, safety, and opportunities available to women and girls and aims to restore what he terms 'biological truth' in federal policies.
