**Summary**

On February 4, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to withdraw the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and to halt future funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for the Near East (UNRWA). The Executive Order also tasked the Secretary of State with reviewing international organizations for radical or anti-American sentiment, especially focusing on the UN Educational, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) due to its history of anti-Israel bias. The decision to cease funding UNRWA is based on accusations of anti-Semitic activities and misuse of facilities for terrorist purposes.

The Executive Order highlights concerns over the UNHRC's effectiveness, suggesting that countries with poor human rights records such as Iran, China, and Cuba have used it to evade scrutiny. The document cites past actions, noting that President Trump previously withdrew from and defunded several UN organizations during his first administration, emphasizing that these entities needed reform to be effective partners in addressing global threats. This move is positioned as an extension of Trump's previous policies aimed at protecting human rights and ensuring UN accountability.
