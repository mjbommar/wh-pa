The executive order titled 'Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling' issued on January 29, 2025, by the President of the United States, aims to address and eliminate perceived radical ideologies in the K-12 education system. The order claims that schools have been promoting anti-American sentiments and ideologies, marginalizing parental oversight, and enforcing divisive concepts like racial discrimination and gender identity issues without parental consent. Furthermore, it asserts that such practices are in violation of specific anti-discrimination laws and parental rights. 

The order mandates the development of an 'Ending Indoctrination Strategy' within 90 days, necessitating the involvement of the Secretaries of Education, Defense, and Health and Human Services, as well as the Attorney General. The strategy should focus on withdrawing federal funding from educational programs promoting these ideologies and ensuring the protection of parental rights. Additionally, the document reinstates the 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education and ensure compliance with laws encouraging educational programs focused on American history.

The executive order also outlines procedures for agency coordination in enforcing these policies and stipulates the creation of awards and programs to recognize and promote patriotic education. It emphasizes the need for federal monitoring and prioritization of resources to ensure adherence to laws promoting patriotic education and compliance with federally mandated educational programs.
