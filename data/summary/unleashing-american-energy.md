The document is an executive order issued by the President of the United States on January 20, 2025, titled 'Unleashing American Energy.' It outlines policies aimed at promoting energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters, enhancing the United States' position as a global energy leader, and reinforcing national and economic security. The order emphasizes a need to revise or eliminate regulatory burdens affecting the development of domestic energy resources and emphasizes the importance of consumer choice in the market, particularly regarding vehicles and appliances.

The order revokes several previous executive orders related to climate and environmental regulations, halting activities associated with the American Climate Corps and redirecting resources per applicable law. The order mandates an examination of existing agency actions and regulations, aiming to expedite and simplify permitting processes, especially energy-related projects, in line with the guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It includes provisions for restarting liquefied natural gas export projects, reviewing domestic non-fuel mineral actions, and reassessing the 'social cost of carbon.'

Agencies are instructed to consider the potential impact of domestic mineral production and seek ways to enhance competitiveness in mining and processing critical minerals. It emphasizes maintaining national security, the economy, and worker protection while ensuring adherence to a regulatory framework aligned with the executive order's policy goals. The document also dictates that its implementation should not infringe on legal authorities or budget-related proposals.
