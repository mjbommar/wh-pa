The United States, under the leadership of the President, has decided to withdraw from certain United Nations (UN) organizations and cease funding several others as of February 4, 2025. This presidential action stems from concerns about anti-Semitism and actions contrary to U.S. interests by specific UN entities. Notably, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) are under scrutiny. The order mandates the U.S. to terminate participation in the UNHRC and conduct a detailed review of its membership with UNESCO.

Moreover, the U.S. will halt funding to UNRWA and undertakes a comprehensive review of all international organizations and treaties it supports to assess their alignment with U.S. interests. This review will help decide if further withdrawals or funding cessations are justifiable. The order also requires notification to relevant UN bodies that the U.S. will not meet its financial obligations for 2025 and previous arrears to these organizations. This action is aligned with applicable laws and is subject to budget availability.
