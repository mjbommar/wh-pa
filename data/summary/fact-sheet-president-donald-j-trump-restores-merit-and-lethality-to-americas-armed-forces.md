On January 27, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order with the aim of restoring merit and enhancing lethality within the United States Armed Forces. This directive bans the use of discriminatory preferences based on race or sex within the military, Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland Security. Furthermore, it abolishes the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices within these departments. The Order also tasks the Secretary of Defense with reviewing the curriculum of United States Service Academies to remove radical DEI and gender ideologies.

The Executive Order addresses concerns about military discipline and culture by refocusing away from what it describes as radical ideologies, believed to have undermined the effectiveness of the armed forces. It suggests that former policies introduced by the Obama and Biden administrations compromised the military's non-political nature and recruitment strength. President Trump aims to return the military to a focus on readiness and cohesiveness by rejecting ideologies that could divide institutions based on race or sex.

The mandate emphasizes a return to a warfighting mindset characterized by merit-based, sex-neutral, and colorblind recruitment and promotion systems. President Trump has also expressed intentions to remove leaders who prioritize social experimentation over military preparedness, aligning with his campaign assertion to maintain a military focused on winning wars rather than adhering to perceived "woke" concerns.
