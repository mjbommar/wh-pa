On March 1, 2025, the President issued an executive order aimed at expanding American timber production. The order highlights the importance of timber for construction and energy, and its role in forest management and wildfire reduction. The order seeks to reverse restrictive federal policies that have forced reliance on foreign timber, leading to economic and security issues. The directives involve the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to facilitate increased timber production through updated guidance, legislative proposals, and streamlined processes.

Specific actions outlined include the adoption of new strategies and programs that speed up project approvals under the Endangered Species Act, establishing annual timber sale targets, and considering new policy exclusions that reduce bureaucratic burdens. Additionally, the order focuses on improving processes by addressing regulations that delay permitting and convening an Endangered Species Committee to tackle obstacles related to timber infrastructure development. The aim is to ensure a swift, thorough review of all issues to bolster domestic timber production, while balancing environmental considerations.

The directive underscores cooperation between multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management, and references authorities granted under U.S. Code and acts pertaining to forest management and endangered species to facilitate these initiatives. By implementing strategies across these agencies, the order supports the sustainable and efficient use of domestic resources to enhance economic and national security.
