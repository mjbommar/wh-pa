# 					President Trump is Making Government Work for You Again				

March 4, 2025

President Donald J. Trump immediately undertook a bold, necessary effort to downsize the federal government by ending the waste, fraud, and abuse that has permeated virtually all aspects of the bureaucracy — making sure government works for the taxpayers who fund it.
    - President Trump  established  the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to maximize government productivity and ensure the best use of taxpayer funds — which has already achieved  billions of dollars in savings  for taxpayers.
    - President Trump  commenced  his plan to downsize the federal bureaucracy and eliminate waste, bloat, and insularity.       - President Trump  ordered  federal workers to return to the office five days a week.
      - President Trump  ordered  federal agencies hire no more than one employee for every four employees who leave.
      - President Trump  ended  the wasteful Federal Executive Institute, which had become a training ground for bureaucrats.
      - President Trump  ordered  the termination of all federal Fake News media contracts. 
    - President Trump is reigning in agencies overtaken by unelected bureaucrats.       - President Trump stopped the  waste, fraud, and abuse within USAID  — ensuring taxpayers are no longer on the hook for funding the pet projects of entrenched bureaucrats, such as sex changes in Guatemala.
      - President Trump  ordered  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, which  funneled  cash to left-wing advocacy groups — to halt operations.
      - The Environmental Protection Agency  canceled  tens of millions of dollars in contracts to left-wing advocacy groups,  announced  an investigation into a scheme by Biden EPA staffers to shield billions of dollars from oversight and accountability, and  put  168 “environmental justice” employees on leave.
      - President Trump  reversed  the massive  over-expansion  of the IRS that took place during the Biden Administration.
      - President Trump  ordered  a review of funding for all non-governmental organizations so taxpayers are no longer funding those that undermine America’s interests.         - The review  identified  15,000 grants worth $60 billion for potential elimination. 
      - The Department of State issued a “pause” on existing foreign aid grants to ensure accountability and efficiency.
      - President Trump  shut down  the wasteful Biden-era “Climate Corps” program. 
    - President Trump  lifted  last-minute collective bargaining agreements issued by the Biden Administration, which sought to impede reform.
