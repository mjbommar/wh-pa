# 					President Trump is Protecting America’s Children				

March 4, 2025

President Donald J. Trump knows America’s children are our future — and he’ll never stop fighting for their right to a healthy, productive upbringing and childhood. That’s why President Trump immediately took action to undo the damaging policies of the Biden Administration on indoctrinating America’s most vulnerable with dangerous, radical policies.
    - President Trump made it the  official policy  of the U.S. government that there are only two sexes.
    - President Trump  ended  the unfair, demeaning practice of forcing women to compete against men in sports — which  resulted  in the NCAA changing its rules.       - The Department of Education  launched  investigations into the California Interscholastic Federation and the Minnesota State High School League over their  failures  to comply. 
    - Health systems across the nation stopped or downsized their sex change programs for minors following President Trump’s “ Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation ” executive order.       - In Illinois, Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital  paused  sex-change surgeries for patients under 19 as it “work[s] to understand the rapidly evolving environment.”
      - In Colorado, Denver Health  announced  it would stop performing sex change surgeries on minor children, while UCHealth said it was  ending  so-called “gender-affirming care” for all minors.
      - In Washington, D.C., Children’s National Hospital “ paused ” prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapies for minors, while Northwest Washington Hospital  did the same .
      - In Virginia, VCU Health and Children’s Hospital of Richmond “ suspended ” providing transgender-related medication and surgeries for minors, while UVA Health also “ suspended ” transgender-related services for minors. 
    - President Trump  ended  the radical, un-American indoctrination of America’s children by eliminating support for divisive, radical “gender ideology” and “equity ideology,” and protecting parents’ rights.
    - President Trump  banned  COVID-19 vaccine mandates at schools that receive federal funding.
