# 					REMARKS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE MARINE ONE DEPARTURE 				

February 22, 2025

South Lawn

(February 22, 2025)

1:35 P.M. EST

     THE PRESIDENT:  So, we had a lot of news over the last 24 hours.  We had the hostages given back today.  It’s disgraceful what’s going on there.  They’re not in great shape, but we’ve also seen them in worse shape.  But the hostages — the six hostages were delivered by Hamas.  What a terrible situation it is. 

I’m going now to make a speech at CPAC, so I think we’re going to include a lot of your subjects.  And I know it’s going to be covered by all of you.  And so, I’ll see you at CPAC.

How are you?
