# 					CFPB Isn’t a Wall Street Regulator, It’s A Main Street Regulator				

February 10, 2025

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) — the [brainchild](https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/30/rohit-chopra-cfpb-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden/) of Sen. Elizabeth Warren — has long functioned as another woke, weaponized arm of the bureaucracy that leverages its power against certain industries and individuals disfavored by so-called “elites.”

For example:
    - CFPB  **used**  its  **slush fund**  — collected from targeting financial institutions — to support radical advocacy groups.  One such group is the  Soros-backed  Mississippi Center for Justice, which  advocates  for “racial and economic justice,”  targets  religious liberty, and  assists  illegal immigrants seeking to skirt our nation’s laws.  Another  is The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia, whose board features senior left-wing officials and has lobbied hundreds of times for more welfare spending.
    - CFBP  **threatened**  banks for refusing to lend to illegal immigrants.
    - CFPB  **targeted**  a Chicago small business after it complained about the city’s rampant crime.
    - CFPB was  **accused**  of mining American citizens’ personal financial information — with a 2017 inspector general’s  **report**  raising significant  **concerns**  about its data security.
    - CFPB  **granted itself**  broad new powers in the waning hours of the lame duck Biden administration.  Described as classic  “government overreach,”  the agency gave itself the authority to regulate Americans’ checking accounts by  dictating  government  price controls  and unilaterally  buried  $50 billion in medical debt.

Under the administration of President Donald J. Trump, the weaponization ends right now.
