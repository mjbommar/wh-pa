# 					President Trump is Putting American Workers First — And Bringing Back American Manufacturing				

March 4, 2025

President Donald J. Trump is standing up for American workers, strengthening American industries, and making clear to the world that America will no longer be ripped off — a push that has already delivered historic results.

**President Trump is leveling the playing field for American workers.**
    - President Trump  restored  a 25% tariff on steel imports and  elevated  the tariff to 25% on aluminum imports to protect these critical American industries from unfair foreign competition.       - The move was praised by the  Steel Manufacturers Association , the  Aluminum Association , and  businesses  across the country.
      - Robert Simon, CEO of JSW Steel USA,  praised  the steel and aluminum tariffs “as a project that will flood the U.S. with jobs as trading partners move their industries to U.S. soil to avoid tariffs.” 
    - President Trump  unveiled  a plan for fair and reciprocal trade, making clear to the world that the United States will no longer tolerate being  ripped off  — a plan met with  praise  across the board.       - American Iron and Steel Institute:  “American steel producers know well the negative impact of foreign unfair trade practices, including subsidies, currency manipulation and other unfair and discriminatory policies and practices, on domestic industries and their workers.”
      - Renewable Fuels Association:  “For almost a decade now, we have spent precious time and resources fighting back against an unfair and unjustified tariff regime imposed by Brazil’s government on U.S. ethanol imports … We thank President Trump for taking this action and hope this reciprocal tariff will help encourage a return to free and fair ethanol trade relationship with Brazil.” 

**President Trump is securing historic investments as companies seek to make their products in America instead of paying tariffs.**
    - Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said President Trump’s tariffs could  push  the car manufacturer to move its production from Mexico to the U.S.
    - Honda is  expected  to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid model in Indiana.
    - After a meeting with President Trump, Stellantis  announced  it will reopen its assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois — putting 1,500 employees back to work — and  build  its next-generation Dodge Durango in Detroit, Michigan. The company also announced new investments in their Toledo, Ohio, and Kokomo, Indiana, facilities.

**In total, President Trump has secured [nearly $2 trillion](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894463845734777158) in new U.S. investments.**
