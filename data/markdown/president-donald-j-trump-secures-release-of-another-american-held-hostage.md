# 					President Donald J. Trump Secures Release of Another American Held Hostage				

February 12, 2025

An American citizen held hostage in Belarus has been released thanks to the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and his administration — the second American released from captivity abroad in the past 24 hours and the eleventh since President Trump took office.

**The remarkable success in freeing American citizens comes as the United States displays a renewed strength under President Trump.**In the [words of Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Adam Boehler](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1889737340513403371), President Trump “has made bringing Americans home a top priority and people respond to that.”
    - **Secretary of State Marco Rubio:**  “President Trump’s strong leadership has led to the release of an American unjustly detained in Belarus and two political prisoners … We remain committed to the release of other U.S. citizens in Belarus and elsewhere.”
    - **Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt:**  “It speaks to President Trump’s dealmaking ability … It’s a remarkable victory on the heels of Marc Fogel returning to America last night.”
    - **Special Envoy Adam Boehler:**  “It’s happening now because the President of the United States has made it a top priority — and he leads through strength.”
    - **Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Chris Smith:**  “A huge win — and a response to President Trump’s Peace through Strength agenda … We’re going to keep working until we get all Americans out.”
    - **U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara McDonald:**  “It is a big day for Team America, for the President, for the Secretary of State…”

**Promises made, promises kept.**
