# 					Illegal Immigrant Killers, Rapists Aren’t Scholars — They’re Criminals				

February 26, 2025

In a strong contender for dumbest statement of the year, disgraced “filmmaker” Michael Moore [lamented](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/media/michael-moore-says-deported-migrants-could-have-cured-cancer/) illegal immigrant criminals being apprehended because they might’ve “discovered the cure for cancer” or “stopped that asteroid.” The only thing more foolish than that statement are the [politicians who oppose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/sick-politicians-want-killers-rapists-roaming-our-streets/) the deportations.

**These are the types of cold-blooded criminals he’s talking about:**
    - A Portuguese national  convicted  of sexual exploitation of a minor—child pornography, apprehended in Philadelphia.
    - A Guatemalan national  charged  with armed home invasion, kidnapping, intimidation, and assault with a dangerous weapon, apprehended in Rhode Island.
    - A Haitian national  charged  with three murders, apprehended in North Carolina.

**White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai:**“Michael Moore is free to visit the quantum computing and particle physics labs that MS-13, TDA, and the cartels are now going to have to set up back home in El Salvador, Venezuela, and Mexico. The Trump Administration will remain focused on putting our own citizens first by mass deporting illegal migrant rapists, murderers, and other criminals out of American communities.”
