President Donald J. Trump knows American energy is the cornerstone of the American advantage — and that having efficient, reliable, and affordable energy is the key to American security.
    - President Trump  declared  a National Energy Emergency to unlock America’s full energy potential and bring down costs for American families.
    - The U.S. is now the  largest  net exporter of natural gas in the world.
    - President Trump  established  the National Energy Dominance Council to maximize use of America’s extensive energy resources.
    - President Trump  rescinded  every one of the Biden Administration’s job-killing, pro-China, anti-American energy regulations.
    - President Trump  terminated  the job-killing “Green New Scam.”
    - President Trump  withdrew  from the disastrous Paris Climate Agreement, which unfairly ripped off our country.
    - President Trump  paused  federal permitting for massive wind farms, which degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American consumers.
    - President Trump  reversed  bureaucratic regulations that impeded Alaska’s ability to develop its vast natural resources.
    - President Trump  re-opened  625 million acres for offshore drilling, which Biden banned in his waning days, in order to “drill, baby, drill.”
    - President Trump  scrapped  an Obama-era rule on greenhouse gases.
    - President Trump  ended  the Liquefied Natural Gas pause and  approved  the first LNG project since the Biden Administration banned them last year.
