# 					Trump Administration Stops Lowering Standards for Police, Firefighters				

February 27, 2025

President Donald J. Trump [declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)[an end](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/) to lower standards in the name of discriminatory “diversity, equity, and inclusion” initiatives — and the Trump Administration continues to make good on that commitment to prioritize merit, not divisive race-based obsessions, in hiring.Yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi [announced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pam-bondi-dismisses-dei-lawsuits-involving-police-officers-and-firefighters) the Department of Justice (DOJ) dismissed several Biden-era lawsuits against police and fire departments who used race-neutral mechanisms — such as standard aptitude tests, physical exams, and credit checks — in their hiring processes, the result of which lowered standards and endangered public safety.
    - DISMISSED:  United States v. City of Durham (North Carolina)        - The Biden DOJ  alleged  discrimination because entry-level firefighter applicants were required to pass a written exam. The city was required to provide compensation and preferential hiring to applicants who were not hired. 
    - DISMISSED:  United States v. Maryland State Police        - The Biden DOJ  alleged  discrimination because applicants were required to pass a written exam and basic physical exam. The agency was required to provide compensation and retroactive seniority to applicants who were not hired. 
    - DISMISSED:  United States v. Cobb County (Georgia)        - The Biden DOJ  alleged  discrimination because firefighter applicants were required to complete a written exam and credit check. The county was required to provide compensation and preferential hiring to applicants who were not hired. 
    - DISMISSED:  United States v. City of South Bend (Indiana)        - The Biden DOJ  alleged  discrimination because police applicants were required to pass a written exam and basic physical exam. 

Americans deserve the best of the best keeping them safe — and in the Trump Administration, anything less is unacceptable.
