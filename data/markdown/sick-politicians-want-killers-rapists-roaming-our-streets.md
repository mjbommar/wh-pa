# 					Sick Politicians Want Killers, Rapists Roaming Our Streets				

February 25, 2025

President Donald J. Trump is removing illegal immigrant killers, rapists, and drug dealers from our streets and sending them back where they belong — but if politicians in so-called “sanctuary” locales had it their way, these vicious criminals would still be free to roam our streets.

**Here is a tiny sample of the illegal immigrant criminals arrested in “sanctuary” destinations under President Trump:**
    - In Saint Paul, Minnesota,  ICE has arrested a Sudanese national convicted of rape of a victim under 13, a Mexican national convicted of criminal sexual conduct against a victim under 14, and a Laotian national convicted of child endangerment and criminal sexual conduct against a victim under 13.       - Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison  warns  law enforcement of “liability if they enforce immigration detainers” and  says  protecting communities from violent illegal immigrant criminals is “not our job.”       - Mayor Melvin Carter  says  targeting violent illegal immigrant criminals is “threaten[ing] our safe spaces” and  calls it  a “rapidly alarming situation.”        - Saint Paul City Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim  reminds  constituents that the police department “cannot and does not cooperate with ICE.” 
    - In Chicago, Illinois,  ICE has arrested a Mexican national convicted of drunk driving resulting in a death (who had an order of removal from 2006), a Mexican national convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute (who had an order of removal from 2022), and a Mexican national convicted of negligent manslaughter.       - Rep. Delia Ramirez  decries  how “welcoming states and sanctuary cities that defend our neighbors” are a “target.”       - Rep. Chuy García  says  “no one should live in fear” of an “immigration raid.”        - Rep. Mike Quigley  advises  illegal immigrants “to become familiar with their rights.” 
    - In Washington State,  ICE has arrested a Salvadoran national convicted of sodomy/anal intercourse with a victim under 13.       - Washington Attorney General Nick Brown  boasts  that “state or local law enforcement” will not be utilized “for immigration enforcement actions.” 
    - In Los Angeles, California,  immigration authorities arrested a Mexican national convicted of rape (who had an order of removal from 1996).       - Mayor Karen Bass  says  “no one should live in fear due to their immigration status.” 
    - In New York City, New York,  immigration authorities arrested a Chinese national convicted of murder.       - Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  reminds  illegal immigrants to “protect” themselves: “ Do not open your door .”
