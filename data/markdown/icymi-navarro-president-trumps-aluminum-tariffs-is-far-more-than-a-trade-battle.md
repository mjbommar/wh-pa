Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports are about far more than just trade — they’re a fight for the survival of an essential American industry.

President Trump is now writing a new story for the United States. With one stroke of Trump’s pen, the Biden era of idled smelters and declining capacity utilization will come to an end as a golden age of American aluminum production regains its rightful place as a pillar of national security and economic strength.
