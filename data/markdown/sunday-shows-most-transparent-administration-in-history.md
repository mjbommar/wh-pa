February 23, 2025

This morning, the Trump Administration was out in force across the TV networks to update Americans on the progress made in the [historic first month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/america-is-back-and-president-trump-is-just-getting-started/) of President Trump’s second term.

**Here’s what you missed:**

**Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on State of the Union**
    - On negotiations to end the war in Ukraine : “Deals only work, Jake, when they’re good for all the parties — and that’s the pathway we’re on here.”
    - On securing a rare earth minerals agreement with Ukraine : “I expect to see a deal signed this week.”
    - On bringing peace to Europe : “The only way you’re going to end the carnage is if you have a relationship with the leaders of both countries that are involved.”

**Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday Morning Futures**
    - On mortgage rates : “Interest rates are down five weeks in a row on the 10-year since President Trump took office — and mortgage rates are down.”
    - On reciprocal tariffs : “We’re just doing what they’re doing and then adding in these other factors. If they remediate those … the tariffs could drop. If they want to continue these unfair trade practices, then the tariff will go up until they are willing to negotiate.”
    - On negotiations around a minerals deal with Ukraine:  “This deal is part of President Trump’s long-arc negotiating strategy for peace between Ukraine and Russia … A partnership between Ukraine and the U.S. … It is a win-win.”

**Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Fox News Sunday**
    - On restoring the Pentagon’s mission : “President Trump has given another set of lawful orders, and they will be followed … If they’re not followed, then those officers will find the door … We feel really good about the direction the Pentagon is headed under President Trump.”
    - On ending the war in Ukraine : “America more than any other country in the world has invested in helping Ukraine defend itself. Now, it’s time for peace.”

**EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday Morning Futures**
    - On getting back to the agency’s core focus : “It’s time to go back to the basics to ensure we are delivering clean air, land, and water, and we are also unleashing energy dominance … That’s the priority at the EPA under President Trump.”

**Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on Face the Nation**
    - On President Trump’s plan for peace and stability in Gaza : “He understands that it makes no sense to endorse old policy prescriptions that have not worked.”

**National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Sunday Morning Futures**
    - On President Trump’s first month : “What you’re seeing under President Trump’s leadership, in just under a month, is bringing multiple wars to an end. He is a president of peace.”
