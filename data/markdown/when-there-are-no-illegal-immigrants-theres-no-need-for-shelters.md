# 					When There Are No Illegal Immigrants, There Is No Need for Shelters				

February 21, 2025

Two years ago, U.S. Border Patrol agents encountered 1,500 illegal immigrants every day in the El Paso sector alone — now, they’re [seeing](https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/border-report-live/border-report-live-where-are-the-migrants/) roughly 80 per day amid President Donald J. Trump’s unprecedented effort to secure the homeland.

Now, organizations that once facilitated the invasion of illegal immigrants are finding out that sheltering them is no longer necessary: **“It’s because migrants are not coming across the border right now,”**[one local reporter said](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1892981316464873632).
    - Catholic Charities  says  they see only “zero to three families” at their McAllen, Texas, shelter and cut staff in Dallas due to the lack of need.
    - A Brownsville, Texas, facility  shut its doors  due to the “sudden decrease in asylum seekers” over the past month.
    - A migrant shelter network in El Paso, Texas,  says  just one or two of its 20 shelters will remain open.
    - Pima County, Arizona,  shut down  two migrant shelters due to the lack of demand in the aftermath of President Trump’s inauguration.
    - In San Diego, California, a shelter “has not  had a single migrant  walk through its doors since President Trump took office” and has since closed altogether.
    - In New York City, a network of shelters that once housed thousands of illegal immigrants have been  closed .
    - In northern Mexico, local news  reports  the flow of illegal immigrants seeking to enter the United States has “decreased enormously” — with facilities that once held thousands of illegals now seeing  just a tiny fraction .
