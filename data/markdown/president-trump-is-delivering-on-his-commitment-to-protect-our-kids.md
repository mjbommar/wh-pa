# 					President Trump is Delivering on His Commitment to Protect our Kids				

February 3, 2025

Last week, President Donald J. Trump [took executive action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/) to protect American children from irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation.**It’s already having its intended effect — preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child’s sex.**Hospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called “gender-affirming care” programs:
    - NEW YORK:  NYU Langone Health has  started  canceling appointments for so-called “gender-affirming care” involving minors. They canceled appointments for “two 12-year-olds who had been scheduled to receive implants that dispense puberty-blocking medication.”
    - COLORADO:  Denver Health  announced  it would stop performing sex change surgeries on minor children, while UCHealth  said  it is ending so-called “gender-affirming care” for all minors.
    - VIRGINIA:  VCU Health and Children’s Hospital of Richmond have  “suspended”  providing transgender-related medication and surgeries for minors, while UVA Health has  “suspended”  all transgender-related services for minors.
    - WASHINGTON, D.C.:  Children’s National Hospital has  “paused”  prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapies for minors, while Northwest Washington Hospital has  done the same .
    - ILLINOIS:  Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago is  “reviewing”  their transgender-related services for minors.
    - PENNSYLVANIA:  Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is  “closely reviewing”  the transgender-related services they provide for minors.

President Trump will always protect American children.**Promises made, promises kept – again.**
