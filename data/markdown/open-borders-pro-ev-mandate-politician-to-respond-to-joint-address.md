# 					Open Borders, Pro EV Mandate Politician to Respond to Joint Address				

March 4, 2025

Elissa Slotkin will respond to President Donald J. Trump’s Joint Address to Congress tonight. Senator Slotkin stands opposed to President Trump’s agenda to lower costs, bring back manufacturing, and secure our borders.

Slotkin voted against overturning Biden’s tailpipe emissions rule, a rule that would force automakers to sell more electric vehicles, killing auto manufacturing jobs. President Trump stood up for American consumers and autoworkers and [repealed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/) this de facto electric vehicle mandate.
    - Slotkin  voted  against congressional disapproval of Biden’s EPA rule seeking to limit tailpipe emissions.       - The House Budget Committee  called  the regulation “a de facto ban on the sale of gas-powered and traditional hybrid vehicles.”
      - Research shows that EV mandates would kill thousands of jobs:         - America First Policy Institute : New Report Exposes Biden-Harris’s Proposed EV Mandates to Cost 200,000 American Jobs           - “The Midwest will suffer the most, with Michigan (-37,000), Indiana (-24,000), and Ohio (-21,000) facing the highest job losses.” 
    - A UAW  study  from 2019 projected that EVs would kill 35,000 jobs at its plants.

Slotkin has repeatedly voted for open borders. President Trump has moved swiftly to secure our borders with attempted crossings in February at the lowest number [ever](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/trump-administrations-immigration-crackdown-leads-to-historic-low-border-apprehensions) recorded.
    - In May 2023, Slotkin  voted  against the H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.
    - In February 2019, Slotkin  voted  to terminate President Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the southern border.       - In March 2019, Slotkin again  voted  again to terminate the declaration in an attempt to override President Trump’s veto. 
    - In July 2024, Slotkin  voted  against a resolution “Strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States border.”
    - Slotkin  said , “I don’t believe that anyone really thinks a wall from sea to shining sea is needed to make us safer.”

**Slotkin is just another out-of-touch politician that wants to hollow out American manufacturing and let criminals flood into our communities.**
