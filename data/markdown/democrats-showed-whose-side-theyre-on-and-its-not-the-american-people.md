# 					Democrats Showed Whose Side They’re On — And it’s Not the American People				

March 5, 2025

Tonight, President Donald J. Trump delivered bold, forward-looking remarks before a joint session of Congress — highlighting the historic accomplishments already achieved in his second term and setting the course for four years of prosperity and strength.

Unfortunately, Congressional Democrats were too consumed by their own hatred of President Trump, refusing to show support for lowering taxes, fighting childhood cancer, capturing terrorists, protecting women and girls in sports, or law and order — to name only a few.

As Dana Perino [said](https://x.com/Pfeiffer47/status/1897140004931166311), “The Democratic Party still has no common sense. They have no ideas and they have no heart. They couldn’t even stand for the most inspiring moments of the speech.”
