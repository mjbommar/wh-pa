# 					Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Directs the Building of the Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield for America				

January 27, 2025

**DEFEND THE UNITED STATES AGAINST MISSILE ATTACK**: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to Build the Iron Dome for America.
    - The Executive Order directs implementation of a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.       - With the goal of providing for the common defense of American citizens, this Order accelerates the development and deployment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layers, proliferated space-based interceptors, a Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, capabilities to defeat salvoes prior to launch, non-kinetic missile defense capabilities, and underlayer and terminal-phase intercept capabilities.
      - It also secures the supply chains for all components of the Iron Dome. 
    - The Executive Order directs a review of theater missile defense posture to defend United States troops deployed abroad and an increase in cooperation on missile defense technology development, capabilities, and operations with partners and allies. 

**ADDRESSING VULNERABILITIES BY MODERNIZING AN OUTDATED SYSTEM**:
    - The threat of attack by ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles remains a catastrophic threat facing the United States.
    - Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons—including hypersonic—has become more complex with the development of next-generation delivery systems by our adversaries.
    - Notwithstanding this increasing threat, United States homeland missile defense policy has been limited to staying ahead of rogue nation threats and accidental or unauthorized missile launches.

**THE IRON DOME WILL FURTHER THE GOALS OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH**: By empowering the United States with a second-strike capability, the Iron Dome will deter adversaries from attacks on the homeland.
    - President Trump is fulfilling his promises: “I will direct our military to begin construction of the great Iron Dome missile defense shield, which will be made all in the USA.”
