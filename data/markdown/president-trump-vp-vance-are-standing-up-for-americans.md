    - More than half (52%) of Ukrainians want a quick end to the war and believe Ukraine “should be open to ceding some territory in exchange for peace,”  according to a November Gallup poll .

      - “Even if the West did come through with all the weapons they have pledged, ‘we don’t have the men to use them,’ one of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s close aides  told  Time’s Simon Shuster, revealing that the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has already reached 43.”

    - Zelesnkyy himself has  acknowledged  that the situation in Ukraine could lead to WWIII, and that without U.S. aid, they would lose: “A third world war could start in Ukraine, continue in Israel, and move on from there to Asia, and then explode somewhere else.”
