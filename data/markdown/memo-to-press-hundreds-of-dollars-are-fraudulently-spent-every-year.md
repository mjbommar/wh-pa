# 					Memo to Press Corps: Hundreds of Billions of Dollars Are Fraudulently Spent Every Year				

February 12, 2025

The New York Times erroneously [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-oval-office.html) that there is no “proof” for “sweeping claims” of “fraud” in federal government spending.Apparently, the Times and other like-minded outlets lack access to a newfangled research tool called Google.The [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833) released a report just last year finding “No area of the federal government is immune to fraud. We estimated that the federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.”President Donald J. Trump is determined to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars and put an end to fraudulent and wasteful spending.
