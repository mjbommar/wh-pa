# 					Monday Morning Wins: Call It the “Trump Effect”				

March 3, 2025

There is no better way to start the week than by celebrating more big wins for Americans under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump.
    - American manufacturing surges amid President Trump’s tariffs:  Automaker Honda is  expected  to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid model in Indiana, while Wisconsin-based Clarios, a leader in low-voltage energy storage,  announced  a $6 billion plan to expand its U.S.-based manufacturing.       - They’re only the latest major companies to announce such a move in alignment with President Trump’s Made in America agenda. Last week, Apple  announced  an historic $500 billion investment that will create 20,000 new U.S.-based jobs, while drug maker Eli Lilly  announced  a $27 billion investment in its U.S.-based manufacturing — bringing the total number of investments secured in President Trump’s second term to  nearly $2 billion . 
    - Border security drives results:  President Trump  announced  illegal border crossings in February — his first full month in office — were the lowest ever recorded,  down 94%  from last February and  down 96%  from the all-time high of the Biden Administration.       - This follows  news  that would-be illegal border crossers have “given up” and are returning to their own countries as ICE arrests of illegal immigrants have  surged  627%.        - Mexican cartel operatives  say  they are “genuinely” fearful “for the first time in years” amid the Trump Administration’s crackdown. 
    - A victory for small businesses:  The U.S. Department of the Treasury  suspended  enforcement of Biden-era Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirements for U.S. citizens — a big win for small businesses faced with burdensome reporting requirements that increased costs and lowered productivity.
