# 					The President and First Lady’s Message on National Read Across America Day, 2025 				

March 2, 2025

Today, we join students, parents, teachers, librarians, and Americans all across our country in commemorating National Read Across America Day—an occasion to celebrate the importance of reading and the unparalleled power of literacy.

Books have always been the bedrock of a great life and a great future.  The simple act of opening a new book expands our knowledge, transforms our minds, and inspires strong leaders and thoughtful citizens.  Whether we are turning through the pages of a book on ancient history, an adventure novel, or classic literature, books will always be the frontier of American imagination and the gateway to the American Dream.

Literacy is a critical component of personal growth, success, and leading lives of happiness and fulfillment, which is why we are fully committed to promoting reading and ensuring America’s children receive the outstanding education they deserve.  The White House has taken direct action through Executive Order to end indoctrination in our classrooms and by directing the Department of Education to empower parents across America to choose the school that best suits their children’s needs and values.

On National Read Across America Day, and every day, our Administration remains committed to instilling a profound love of reading in our youth and forming the next generation of patriotic leaders.  The next chapter of our Nation’s Golden Age begins with opening a new book—and harnessing the full potential of our youngest generation.
