  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum revokes the 2021 memorandum that had previously repealed the Mexico City Policy and reinstates the 2017 version of the policy. The Mexico City Policy restricts federal funding for non-governmental organizations that provide abortion services, counseling, or referrals. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to coordinate with Health and Human Services to implement these restrictions across all global health assistance programs. It specifically prohibits U.S. taxpayer dollars from funding organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs.",
  "eli5": "The President changed a rule about how the United States spends money in other countries. Now, the government won't give money to groups in other countries that help people get abortions or talk about abortion.",
