Mandating immediate action on excluding or removing identified threats\n4. Evaluating and adjusting existing immigration regulations and procedures\n5. Strengthening refugee verification processes\n6. Reviewing visa programs for potential security risks\n7. Ensuring proper allocation of resources for denaturalization cases\n8. Evaluating immigrant assimilation programs",
  "eli5": "This is a rule that makes it harder for people from other countries to come into the United States if they might want to hurt Americans. It tells government workers to check people more carefully before letting them in and to watch out for anyone who might cause trouble.",
