  "summary": "This is a Presidential Proclamation, not an Executive Order, declaring January 20, 2025, as the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. The proclamation commemorates Dr. King's legacy of civil rights leadership, particularly referencing his 'I Have a Dream' speech and his advocacy for racial equality through nonviolent protest. President Trump connects Dr. King's vision to his own administration's achievements regarding African American employment, support for historically black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, and school choice. The proclamation encourages Americans to honor Dr. King through prayer and community service.",
  "eli5": "The President made an official announcement to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 20, 2025. This special day remembers Dr. King, who worked very hard to make sure everyone in America would be treated fairly and equally, no matter what they looked like.",
  "issues": [
    "This appears to be a draft proclamation dated in the future (2025)",
    "The document assumes Donald Trump will be president in 2025, which is speculative",
    "The proclamation appears to politicize MLK Day by highlighting specific administration achievements",
    "January 20, 2025 would be Inauguration Day, which could create confusion with the holiday observance",
    "The document references Trump's 'first Administration' and implies a second term that has not occurred"
