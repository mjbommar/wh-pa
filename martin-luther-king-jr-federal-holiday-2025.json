TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2025, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday.\u00a0 On this day, I encourage all Americans to honor Dr. King\u2019s legacy by praying for our Nation and working to restore the American Dream in their communities through acts of service.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.\n\n\n\n",
