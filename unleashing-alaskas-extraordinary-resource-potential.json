Unlocking this bounty of natural wealth will raise the prosperity of our citizens while helping to enhance our Nation\u2019s economic and national security for generations to come. \u00a0By developing these resources to the fullest extent possible, we can help deliver price relief for Americans, create high-quality jobs for our citizens, ameliorate our trade imbalances, augment the Nation\u2019s exercise of global energy dominance, and guard against foreign powers weaponizing energy supplies in theaters of geopolitical conflict.\n\nUnleashing this opportunity, however, requires an immediate end to the assault on Alaska\u2019s sovereignty and its ability to responsibly develop these resources for the benefit of the Nation. \u00a0It is, therefore, imperative to immediately reverse the punitive restrictions implemented by the previous administration that specifically target resource development on both State and Federal lands in Alaska.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy.It is the policy of the United States to:\n\n(a) \u00a0fully avail itself of Alaska\u2019s vast lands and resources for the benefit of the Nation and the American citizens who call Alaska home;\n\n(b) \u00a0efficiently and effectively maximize the development and production of the natural resources located on both Federal and State lands within Alaska;\n\n(c) \u00a0expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects in Alaska; and\n\n(d) \u00a0prioritize the development of Alaska\u2019s liquified natural gas (LNG) potential, including the sale and transportation of Alaskan LNG to other regions of the United States and allied nations within the Pacific region.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Specific Agency Actions.(a) \u00a0The heads of all executive departments and agencies, including but not limited to the Secretary of the Interior; the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere; and the Secretary of the Army acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Public Works, shall exercise all lawful authority and discretion available to them and take all necessary steps to:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0rescind, revoke, revise, amend, defer, or grant exemptions from any and all regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions that are inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including but not limited to agency actions promulgated, issued, or adopted between January 20, 2021, and January 20, 2025; and\n\n(ii) \u00a0prioritize the development of Alaska\u2019s LNG potential, including the permitting of all necessary pipeline and export infrastructure related to the Alaska LNG Project, giving due consideration to the economic and national security benefits associated with such development.\n\n(b)\u00a0 In addition to the actions outlined in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of the Interior shall exercise all lawful authority and discretion available to him and take all necessary steps to:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0withdraw Secretarial Order 3401 dated June 1, 2021 (Comprehensive Analysis and Temporary Halt on All Activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Relating to the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program);\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rescind the cancellation of any leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, other than such lease cancellations as the Secretary of the Interior determines are consistent with the policy interests described in section 2 of this order, initiate additional leasing through the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and issue all permits, right-of-way permits, and easements necessary for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas from leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge;\n\n(iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rescind the final supplemental environmental impact statement entitled \u201cCoastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement,\u201d which is referred to in \u201cNotice of Availability of the Final Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, Alaska\u201d 89 *Fed.

  "summary": "This Executive Order focuses on maximizing resource development in Alaska by reversing various environmental and regulatory restrictions implemented during 2021-2025. The order directs multiple federal agencies, particularly the Department of Interior, to rescind previous orders, reinstate prior policies, and expedite permitting for energy and natural resource projects. Key areas include the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, National Petroleum Reserve, and Alaska LNG development. The order emphasizes economic development, energy security, and state sovereignty while directing reviews of land management, hunting rights, and infrastructure projects.",
  "eli5": "The President signed an order saying Alaska can use more of its natural resources like oil, gas, and minerals that are found in its land. This would help create jobs and make America less dependent on other countries for energy.",
