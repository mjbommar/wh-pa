  "summary": "This document outlines President Trump's Executive Order that rescinds 78 executive actions previously issued by President Biden. The order primarily targets three policy areas: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives across federal government, immigration/border policies, and climate/energy regulations. The order specifically aims to eliminate what it characterizes as 'radical DEI ideology,' reverse catch-and-release immigration policies, halt refugee programs, eliminate emissions standards, and reverse electric vehicle mandates. The order also initiates a comprehensive review of all Biden administration executive actions for potential future rescission.",
  "eli5": "The new president (Trump) signed a paper that cancels out many rules the last president (Biden) made. It's like erasing what was written before and writing new rules about things like immigration, climate change, and how the government treats different groups of people.",
