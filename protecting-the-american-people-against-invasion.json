  "summary": "This Executive Order from January 20, 2025 implements sweeping changes to immigration enforcement policy. It revokes several Biden administration immigration orders and establishes an aggressive enforcement framework targeting unauthorized immigrants. Key provisions include: establishing Homeland Security Task Forces in all states; mandating detention of removable aliens; expanding state/local law enforcement cooperation through 287(g) agreements; implementing visa bond requirements; reinstating the VOICE office for victims of crimes by removable aliens; restricting parole and TPS designations; cutting funding to sanctuary jurisdictions; increasing information sharing between agencies; reviewing funding to NGOs supporting unauthorized immigrants; denying public benefits to unauthorized immigrants; and increasing immigration enforcement staffing. The order emphasizes maximum enforcement of immigration laws and removal of unauthorized immigrants.",
  "eli5": "This order is like a new set of strict rules about who can come into and stay in America. It tells police and government workers to be extra careful about checking if people are allowed to be here, and to send home people who aren't supposed to be here.",
