  "summary": "This Presidential Proclamation, dated January 20, 2025, exercises the President's constitutional pardon power under Article II, Section 2 to address convictions related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol events. The proclamation takes two major actions: (1) commutes the sentences to time served for 14 specifically named individuals, including prominent figures like Stewart Rhodes and others, and (2) grants full, complete, and unconditional pardons to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to the Capitol events. Additionally, it directs the Attorney General to issue pardon certificates, ensure immediate release of imprisoned individuals, and pursue dismissal of all pending indictments related to January 6 events. The proclamation frames these actions as correcting a 'grave national injustice' and promoting 'national reconciliation.'",
  "eli5": "The President used special powers given by the Constitution to forgive people who got in trouble during the events at the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Some people will be let out of jail early, and others won't be in trouble anymore for what they did that day.",
