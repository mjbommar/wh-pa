  "summary": "This presidential proclamation grants pardons and sentence commutations to individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021 events at the U.S. Capitol. The proclamation specifically names 14 individuals whose sentences are commuted to time served, and broadly pardons all other individuals convicted of related offenses. It directs the Attorney General to immediately issue pardon certificates, release currently imprisoned individuals, and dismiss pending indictments with prejudice. The authority is derived from Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which grants the President pardon powers.",
  "eli5": "The President used special powers given by the Constitution to forgive people who were in trouble for what happened at the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Some people who were in jail will be let out, and others won't be in trouble anymore.",
