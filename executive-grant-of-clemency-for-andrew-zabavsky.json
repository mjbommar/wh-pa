  "summary": "President Donald Trump issued an Executive Grant of Clemency (full pardon) to Andrew Zabavsky on January 22, 2025. The pardon relates to Zabavsky's convictions in the U.S. District Court for D.C. under 18 USC \u00a7 371 (conspiracy) and 18 USC \u00a7 1512 (witness tampering), for which he received concurrent 48-month prison sentences, 3 years supervised release, and $200 in special assessments on September 12, 2024. The pardon is issued under the President's Constitutional authority (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) and delegates authority to the Pardon Attorney to execute the grant.",
  "eli5": "The President used his special power to forgive someone named Andrew Zabavsky who was in trouble with the law and was supposed to go to jail. This means Mr. Zabavsky doesn't have to go to jail anymore and his record is cleared.",
