Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), which misinterpreted the Constitution as permanently excluding people of African descent from eligibility for United States citizenship solely based on their race.\n\nBut the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.\u00a0 The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d\u00a0 Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that \u201ca person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s text.\n\nAmong the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: \u00a0(1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States at the time of said person\u2019s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0(a) \u00a0It is the policy of the United States that no department or agency of the United States government shall issue documents recognizing United States citizenship, or accept documents issued by State, local, or other governments or authorities purporting to recognize United States citizenship, to persons: \u00a0(1) when that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person\u2019s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or (2) when that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person\u2019s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth.\n\n(b)\u00a0 Subsection (a) of this section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order.\n\n(c)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect the entitlement of other individuals, including children of lawful permanent residents, to obtain documentation of their United States citizenship.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Enforcement. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the regulations and policies of their respective departments and agencies are consistent with this order, and that no officers, employees, or agents of their respective departments and agencies act, or forbear from acting, in any manner inconsistent with this order.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The heads of all executive departments and agencies shall issue public guidance within 30 days of the date of this order regarding this order\u2019s implementation with respect to their operations and activities.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Definitions.\u00a0 As used in this order:\n\n(a) \u00a0\u201cMother\u201d means the immediate female biological progenitor.\n\n(b) \u00a0\u201cFather\u201d means the immediate male biological progenitor.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0General Provisions. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0 \u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b)\u00a0 This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order aims to redefine and limit birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. It establishes that children born in the US to mothers who are either unlawfully present or temporarily legally present (e.g., on tourist/student visas) AND whose fathers are not US citizens or permanent residents will not automatically receive US citizenship. The order directs federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to such individuals born 30 days after the order's date. It includes specific definitions of 'mother' and 'father' as biological progenitors and requires agencies to update their policies accordingly within 30 days.",
  "eli5": "This order changes who gets to be an American citizen when they're born in America. If someone's mom isn't allowed to be in America or is just visiting temporarily, and their dad isn't an American citizen or permanent resident, their baby won't automatically become an American citizen anymore.",
