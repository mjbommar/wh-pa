  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, significantly modifies the interpretation of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. It directs federal agencies to deny U.S. citizenship documentation to children born in the United States if: (1) their mother was unlawfully present in the U.S. and their father was not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth, or (2) their mother was temporarily legally present (e.g., on a tourist or student visa) and their father was not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. The order applies only to births occurring 30 days after the order's issuance and requires federal agencies to issue implementation guidance within that timeframe.",
  "eli5": "This order changes who can become an American citizen when they are born in America. If a baby's mom is not allowed to be in America or is just visiting temporarily, and their dad isn't an American citizen or permanent resident, the baby won't automatically become an American citizen anymore.",
