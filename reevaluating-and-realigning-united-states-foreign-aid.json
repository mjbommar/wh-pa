  "summary": "This Executive Order implements a significant pause and review of all U.S. foreign aid programs. The order establishes a 90-day pause on new obligations and disbursements of foreign development assistance while requiring comprehensive reviews of existing programs. The Secretary of State, in consultation with OMB, must evaluate each program's efficiency and alignment with U.S. foreign policy. Programs can resume before the 90-day period if reviewed and approved, and the Secretary of State may grant waivers for specific programs. The order emphasizes realigning foreign aid with the President's foreign policy objectives and addresses perceived misalignment between current aid programs and American interests.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to check if the money America gives to help other countries is being used in the right way. For three months, they're going to stop giving new money and look at all the programs to make sure they're helping America's friendships with other countries.",
