  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, establishes an 'America First' directive for U.S. foreign policy. The order requires the Secretary of State to implement guidance aligning the State Department's operations with an America First approach. It contains standard administrative provisions preserving existing executive authority and budget functions, while clarifying that it creates no new legal rights or grounds for litigation. The order appears designed to formally codify an America First foreign policy doctrine within State Department operations.",
  "eli5": "The President told the people who handle America's relationships with other countries that they must always think about what's best for America and Americans first before considering other countries.",
