  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, establishes an 'America First' directive for U.S. foreign policy. It instructs the Secretary of State to realign the State Department's operations to prioritize American interests above all else. The order contains standard provisions preserving existing executive authority and budget functions, while clarifying it creates no new legal rights. It's a broad policy directive that signals a significant shift in foreign policy orientation, though the specific implementation details are left to the Secretary of State's discretion.",
  "eli5": "This is like a rule from the President telling everyone who works on America's relationships with other countries to always think about what's best for America first. It's like saying 'make sure our country's needs are the most important when making decisions about working with other countries.'",
  "issues": [
    "The order lacks specific criteria for defining or measuring 'American interests'",
    "No timeline is provided for implementation beyond 'as soon as practicable'",
    "Potential impacts on existing international agreements and relationships are not addressed",
    "No clear metrics or oversight mechanisms are established",
    "Could create tensions with allies who may view this as overly nationalist policy"
