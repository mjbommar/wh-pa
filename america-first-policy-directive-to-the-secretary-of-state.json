  "summary": "This Executive Order establishes an 'America First' directive for U.S. foreign policy. The order instructs the Secretary of State to realign the State Department's operations, policies, programs, and personnel to prioritize American interests. The order contains standard provisions preserving existing executive authority and clarifying that it creates no new legal rights. The directive appears largely symbolic and declaratory in nature, as it provides no specific policy changes or detailed implementation requirements beyond the general 'America First' mandate.",
  "eli5": "This is like a boss telling their workers that from now on, when making decisions about dealing with other countries, they need to think about what's best for America first. It's similar to saying 'our family comes first' when making important choices.",
