  "summary": "This presidential action announces appointments of acting officials to Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions for the incoming administration effective January 20, 2025. Pursuant to constitutional and statutory authority, particularly the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (5 U.S.C. 3345), the President has designated various individuals to serve in acting capacities across all major executive departments and agencies until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed. The appointments include all 15 executive departments plus several independent agencies and key administrative positions.",
  "eli5": "The President picked temporary leaders to run different parts of the government until permanent leaders can be chosen. It's like having substitute teachers run the school until new permanent teachers are hired.",
