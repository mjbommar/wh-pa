  "summary": "This Presidential directive announces the appointment of acting officials to Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions effective January 20, 2025. The President, exercising authority under the Constitution and Federal Vacancies Reform Act, has designated various individuals to temporarily perform the duties of key executive branch positions until permanent appointments are made and confirmed. The directive covers all major Cabinet positions including State, Treasury, Defense, and Justice, as well as important agency heads like the FBI Director, CIA Director, and NASA Administrator. This appears to be a standard transition of power document establishing interim leadership across the federal government.",
  "eli5": "When a new President takes over, they need people to run different parts of the government right away. This is a list of temporary leaders who will do these important jobs until permanent ones are chosen.",
