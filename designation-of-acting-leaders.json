  "summary": "This Presidential directive, dated January 20, 2025, designates acting officials to temporarily fill Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions in the federal government. Pursuant to constitutional and statutory authority, particularly the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (5 U.S.C. 3345), President Trump has appointed acting officials to serve in key leadership roles across major federal departments and agencies until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed. The directive covers all 15 executive departments plus additional significant agencies and positions including the EPA, CIA, FBI, and NASA among others.",
  "eli5": "The President picked temporary leaders to run important parts of the government until permanent leaders can be chosen. It's like having substitute teachers run different school departments until the permanent teachers are hired.",
