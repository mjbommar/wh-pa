  "summary": "This Executive Order focuses on restoring and establishing names that honor 'American greatness.' It contains three major actions: (1) It directs changes to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names membership and policies to prioritize honoring 'visionary and patriotic Americans'; (2) It reinstates 'Mount McKinley' as the name for North America's highest peak (currently known as Denali), while maintaining Denali National Park and Preserve's name; and (3) It renames the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America.' The order requires implementation within 30 days for the geographic renamings and provides for additional recommendations for honoring patriots, particularly around America's 250th anniversary celebration.",
