  "summary": "This Presidential Action directs the Department of Transportation and FAA to immediately cease all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring practices and return to merit-based hiring procedures. The order asserts that the previous administration's DEI initiatives compromised aviation safety by prioritizing diversity criteria over qualifications and competency. It mandates a review of personnel in critical safety positions and requires appropriate action to replace individuals who fail to demonstrate required capabilities. The order characterizes DEI hiring practices as illegal and discriminatory, arguing they disadvantage qualified candidates who don't meet specific demographic criteria.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to make sure that people who work at airports and help keep planes safe are hired because they're good at their jobs, not because of what they look like or other special reasons. It's like picking players for a sports team based on who plays the best, not on other things about them.",
