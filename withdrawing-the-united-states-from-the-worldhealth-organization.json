  "summary": "This Executive Order directs the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The order cites concerns about WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of reforms, alleged political influence from member states, and disproportionate financial burden on the US compared to other nations. Key actions include: revoking the 2021 retraction of withdrawal notice, halting fund transfers to WHO, recalling US personnel, identifying alternative partners, reviewing global health security strategy, and ceasing negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement. The order includes standard provisions about implementation within existing legal frameworks and appropriations.",
  "eli5": "The President decided that America should leave a big international health group called WHO because he thinks they didn't do a good job during COVID-19 and it costs America too much money compared to other countries.",
