  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, directs the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). The order cites several justifications, including the WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, failure to implement reforms, alleged political influence from member states, and disproportionate financial burden on the US compared to other nations like China. The order establishes specific actions including: stopping US funding to WHO, recalling US personnel, identifying alternative partners for global health initiatives, reviewing the US Global Health Security Strategy, and ceasing negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement. The order also revokes previous executive actions that had maintained US participation in WHO, including EO 13987.",
  "eli5": "The President signed an order saying America will leave a big group called the World Health Organization that helps countries work together on health problems. The President thinks this group isn't doing a good job and costs America too much money, so we're going to stop being part of it and find other ways to work with other countries on health issues.",
