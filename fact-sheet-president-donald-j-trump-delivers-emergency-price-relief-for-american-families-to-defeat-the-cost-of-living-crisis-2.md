Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Rescinds Initial List of Harmful Biden Executive Actions
==============================================================================================

January 22, 2025 



**ENDING RADICAL ideology and bad governance:** Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order rescinding a record number of damaging executive actions issued by the prior administration.

* This Executive Order rescinds 78 executive actions signed by President Biden, most of them executive orders.
  + In comparison, President Biden issued 77 executive orders in his entire first year.
* The 78 rescinded actions cover all manner of policy, with highlights eliminating radical DEI ideology, open border policies, and climate extremism from our federal government.
  + The American people can expect even more rescissions in the year, as the Order directs review of all of President Biden’s executive actions.

**The Biden Administration caused record damage:** Policies flowing from Biden Executive Orders have made our Country Less Secure, Less Prosperous, and Less United.  A Golden Age for America starts today.  

* President Trump is working to reverse some of Biden’s most harmful policies:
  + Racial equity: Several EOs (including President Biden’s first EO) imposed illegal racial equity requirements across all levels of government.
  + Open border policies: Several EOs mandated catch-and-release, stopped deportations of criminals, imported overwhelming numbers of unvetted refugees into local communities, and granted taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens.
  + Anti-energy climate activism: Several EOs imposed crushing emissions standards designed to end gas powered vehicles, set an electric vehicle mandate by 2030, cancel the Keystone Pipeline, stop drilling, and prevent permitting.

**PRESIDENT trump WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN**

* President Trump: “I can undo almost everything Biden did, he through executive order. And on day one, much of that will be undone.”
* President Trump: “We will terminate every diversity, equity, and inclusion program across the entire federal government.”
* President Trump: “On day one, I will terminate every open border policy of crooked Joe Biden and the Biden administration.” “We’re going to have a great border, we’re going to have more energy than you’ve ever had, and we’re never going back.”
