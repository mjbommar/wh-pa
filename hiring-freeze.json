  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum implements an immediate hiring freeze across the federal executive branch effective January 20, 2025. The freeze prohibits filling vacant civilian positions and creating new positions, with specific exceptions. Key exemptions include military personnel, positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, public safety, and those necessary for Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits administration. The OPM Director may grant additional exemptions as needed. Within 90 days, OMB must develop a workforce reduction plan in consultation with OPM and USDS. Once implemented, the freeze expires for most agencies except the IRS. The memo prohibits circumventing the freeze through outside contracting and allows for internal reallocation of resources for essential services. Presidential appointments, SES positions, and certain excepted service appointments are excluded from the freeze.",
  "eli5": "The President told most government offices they can't hire new workers for a while, except for important jobs like military and safety workers. It's like pressing a pause button on hiring new people until they can figure out how to make the government smaller and work better.",
