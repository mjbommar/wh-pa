  "summary": "This presidential memorandum implements a federal civilian hiring freeze across the executive branch effective January 20, 2025. The freeze prohibits filling vacant positions and creating new positions, with specific exemptions for military personnel, immigration enforcement, national security, public safety, and certain benefit programs. The Director of OPM can grant additional exemptions as necessary. Within 90 days, OMB must develop a workforce reduction plan in consultation with OPM and USDS. Once implemented, the freeze expires for all agencies except the IRS, which remains frozen until Treasury determines otherwise. The order prohibits circumvention through outside contracting while allowing for internal reallocations to meet critical needs. It preserves presidential appointments, SES positions, and certain excepted service appointments.",
  "eli5": "The President told most government offices they can't hire new workers for a while. Some important jobs like soldiers and police are allowed to keep hiring, and the government will make a plan to have fewer workers in the future.",
