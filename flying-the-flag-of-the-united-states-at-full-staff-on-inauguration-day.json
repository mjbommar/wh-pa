  "summary": "This Presidential Proclamation orders that the American flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day 2025 and all future Inauguration Days. The order applies to all federal buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and U.S. facilities abroad. The proclamation specifically notes that after Inauguration Day, the flag should return to half-staff in accordance with Proclamation 10876, which ordered flags lowered for 30 days following the death of former President Jimmy Carter.",
  "eli5": "The President said that on Inauguration Day, which is when a new president takes over, all American flags should be raised to the very top of their flagpoles to celebrate. After the celebration, the flags will go back to being halfway up to remember former President Carter who recently passed away.",
  "issues": [
    "The proclamation creates a potential conflict with other flag-lowering proclamations that might coincide with future Inauguration Days",
    "The document appears to be a draft/prepared version as indicated by '(AS PREPARED)' notation",
    "The timing of this proclamation coincides with a period of national mourning for President Carter, which could raise questions about protocol precedence"
