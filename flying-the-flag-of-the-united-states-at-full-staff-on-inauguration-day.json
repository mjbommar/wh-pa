  "summary": "This Presidential Proclamation orders that the United States flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day 2025 and all future Inauguration Days. The order applies to all federal buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and U.S. facilities abroad. The proclamation specifically notes that after Inauguration Day, the flag should return to half-staff in accordance with Proclamation 10876, which was issued following the death of former President Jimmy Carter, until the 30-day mourning period concludes.",
  "eli5": "The President said that on Inauguration Day, which is when a new president takes office, the American flag should be raised all the way up to the top of flagpoles everywhere in America and at American buildings around the world. After the day is over, the flag will go back to being halfway up to honor former President Carter who recently passed away.",
