  "summary": "This Presidential Proclamation orders that the United States flag be flown at full-staff on Inauguration Day 2025 and all future Inauguration Days. The order applies to all federal buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and U.S. facilities abroad. The proclamation specifically notes that after Inauguration Day, the flag should return to half-staff in accordance with Proclamation 10876, which honors the death of former President Jimmy Carter until the 30-day mourning period concludes.",
  "eli5": "The President made a rule that on Inauguration Day, which is when a new president takes office, all American flags should be raised all the way up on their flagpoles to show respect for this special day. After the celebration is over, the flags will go halfway down again to remember former President Carter who recently passed away.",
