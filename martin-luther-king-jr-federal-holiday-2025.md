Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2025

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES America

A PROCLAMATION

Over 60 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., courageously climbed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and shared his dream for our Nation — that we would fulfill our Founding Principle that all men are created equal.  Dr. King dedicated his life to fighting for every American’s right to pursue their own American Dream, and his courage changed the world.  Today, we honor Dr. King’s legacy of leadership, inspiration, and community service by working to ensure all Americans can share in our Nation’s promise of freedom and equality for all.

From the humble beginnings of a Baptist church in Georgia, Dr. King’s faith in God was central to his message that every person should be “judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”  Dr. King’s powerful preaching inspired millions to join him in the nonviolent protest of a corrupt system.  While helping to lead the Civil Rights Movement, he faced unjust prosecutions, institutional resistance, and violence against himself and his supporters, overcoming these challenges through his faith in God and dedication to our Founding Principles.  Dr. King’s life reminds us that we are, and have always been, a great Nation.

President Ronald Reagan first proclaimed a Federal holiday commemorating Dr. King’s extraordinary life almost 40 years ago, and it was my distinct honor as your President to celebrate the 55th anniversary of Dr. King’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech during my first Administration.  This Martin Luther King Jr. Day is particularly historic too.  As I take the Oath of Office for the second time, I am honored to celebrate Dr. King’s momentous legacy again and recommit my Administration to fighting for the “equality of opportunity” for all Americans.

Just a few short years ago, my Administration achieved the lowest unemployment and poverty rates for black Americans ever recorded to that point.  We won massive funding for historically black colleges and universities, reformed the criminal justice system, and fought for school choice.  Whatever your color, race, religion, or creed, my Administration ensured neighborhoods were safe, families were secure, and jobs were abundant — and we will do it all again.  As Dr. King courageously marched for jobs and freedom, together, with faith in God and committed to our Founding Principles, we will restore the American Dream for all Americans.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2025, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday.  On this day, I encourage all Americans to honor Dr. King’s legacy by praying for our Nation and working to restore the American Dream in their communities through acts of service.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.
