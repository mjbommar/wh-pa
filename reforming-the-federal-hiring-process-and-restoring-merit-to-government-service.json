or\n\n(iii)\u00a0 the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order aims to reform federal hiring practices by establishing a new Federal Hiring Plan focused on merit-based recruitment. The order directs the creation of a comprehensive plan within 120 days that prioritizes hiring skilled individuals committed to American values and Constitutional principles while explicitly prohibiting hiring decisions based on race, sex, or religion. The plan mandates improvements in hiring efficiency, including reducing time-to-hire to under 80 days, enhancing candidate communication, and modernizing recruitment technology. It establishes oversight mechanisms through OPM and requires specific improvements for Senior Executive Service positions across major federal agencies.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to make it easier and fairer to hire people to work for the government. The new rules say that jobs should go to people who are good at their work and care about America's laws, not based on what they look like or what they believe.",
