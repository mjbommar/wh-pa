and\n\n(vii) \u00a0ensure Department and Agency leadership, or their designees, are active participants in implementing the new processes and throughout the full hiring process.\n\n(c) \u00a0This Federal Hiring Plan shall include specific agency plans to improve the allocation of Senior Executive Service positions in the Cabinet agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration, the Social Security Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration, to best facilitate democratic leadership, as required by law, within each agency.\n\n(d) \u00a0The Federal Hiring Plan shall provide specific best practices for the human resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice and recommendations as appropriate from DOGE.\n\nSec. 3.\u00a0 Accountability and Reporting. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall establish clear performance metrics to evaluate the success of these reforms, and request agency analysis on a regular basis.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Office of Personnel Management shall consult with Federal agencies, labor organizations, and other stakeholders to monitor progress and ensure that the reforms are meeting the needs of both candidates and agencies.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 General Provisions. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals; or\n\n(iii)\u00a0 the functions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee relating to its conduct of monetary policy.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order aims to reform federal hiring practices by focusing on merit-based recruitment while explicitly prohibiting consideration of factors like 'equity' and 'gender identity.' The order requires development of a Federal Hiring Plan within 120 days that prioritizes hiring individuals committed to government efficiency and constitutional values. Key provisions include implementing technical assessments, reducing time-to-hire to under 80 days, improving candidate communication, and modernizing recruitment technology. The order establishes performance metrics and reporting requirements while maintaining existing legal authorities and limitations.",
  "eli5": "The President made new rules about how the government hires people for jobs. The rules say that the government should pick people who are really good at their jobs and care about following America's rules, without choosing people based on things like their race or gender.",
