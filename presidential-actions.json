  "summary": "This appears to be a list of Presidential Actions from whitehouse.gov, all dated January 20, 2025. The actions cover a wide range of policy areas including immigration enforcement, federal hiring practices, DEI programs, gender policies, government efficiency, foreign policy, and resource management. These appear to be executive orders or presidential memoranda intended to be issued at the start of a new presidential administration.",
  "eli5": "This is a list of rules that a president wants to make on their first day in office. Just like how a new teacher might make new classroom rules on the first day of school, these are new rules for how the government should work.",
