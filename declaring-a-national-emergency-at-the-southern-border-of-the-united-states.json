  "summary": "This proclamation declares a national emergency at the U.S. southern border, citing threats from cartels, criminal gangs, terrorists, human traffickers, and drug smugglers. The order authorizes military deployment to assist the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border. It directs the Secretary of Defense to deploy Armed Forces, including Ready Reserve and National Guard, to support border control operations. The order also mandates construction of additional physical barriers, authorizes drone countermeasures within 5 miles of the border, and requires reports on implementation within 30 and 90 days. It revokes a previous 2021 proclamation that had terminated the border emergency and halted wall construction. The order invokes specific emergency powers under the National Emergencies Act and military construction authority.",
  "eli5": "The President says there's a big problem at the border between the United States and Mexico, with dangerous people and drugs coming in. He's sending soldiers to help guard the border and build more walls to keep Americans safe.",
