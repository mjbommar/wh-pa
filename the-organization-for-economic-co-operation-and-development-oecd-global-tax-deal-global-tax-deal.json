  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum addresses the OECD Global Tax Deal supported by the previous administration. The memorandum declares that the Deal has no force or effect in the United States without Congressional action. It directs the Secretary of Treasury and US Representative to OECD to formally notify the OECD of this position. Additionally, it requires the Treasury Secretary and Trade Representative to investigate foreign countries' tax practices that may discriminate against or disproportionately affect US companies, and develop protective measures in response. The memo includes standard provisions regarding implementation within existing legal authority and budgetary constraints.",
  "eli5": "The President wrote a note saying America won't follow other countries' tax rules unless Congress agrees to them. He also asked his team to watch out for other countries trying to be unfair to American companies with their tax rules.",
