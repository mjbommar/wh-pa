  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum addresses the OECD Global Tax Deal agreed to by the previous administration. The memorandum effectively nullifies U.S. participation in the deal by declaring it has no force or effect without Congressional approval. It directs the Treasury Secretary and U.S. Representative to the OECD to formally notify the OECD of this position. Additionally, it requires the Treasury Secretary and Trade Representative to investigate potential discriminatory foreign tax practices against U.S. companies and develop protective measures in response. The memorandum gives officials 60 days to deliver findings and recommendations, while maintaining standard provisions about implementation within existing legal and budgetary constraints.",
  "eli5": "The President is telling other countries that America won't follow their special tax rules unless Congress agrees to them first. He's also asking his team to check if other countries are being unfair to American companies with their tax rules and figure out how to protect them.",
