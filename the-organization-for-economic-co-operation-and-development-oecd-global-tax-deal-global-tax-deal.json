  "summary": "This Presidential memorandum addresses the OECD Global Tax Deal, declaring it has no force or effect in the United States without Congressional approval. The memo directs the Secretary of Treasury and US Representative to OECD to formally notify the OECD that prior commitments regarding the Global Tax Deal are not binding. It also requires the Treasury Secretary and Trade Representative to investigate potential discriminatory foreign tax practices affecting US companies and develop protective response options within 60 days. The memo includes standard provisions preserving existing executive authority and clarifying it creates no new legal rights.",
  "eli5": "The President is telling other countries that America won't follow their global tax rules unless Congress agrees to them first. The President also wants to check if other countries are treating American companies unfairly with their tax rules and figure out how to protect them.",
