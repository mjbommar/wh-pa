  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, focuses on expanding and clarifying the military's role in border security operations. The order directs the Secretary of Defense to revise the Unified Command Plan to give USNORTHCOM explicit authority to 'seal the borders' against various threats including unlawful migration and drug trafficking. It establishes new planning requirements for border security operations and requires continuous assessment of options to protect U.S. territory. The order frames border security challenges as threats to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, effectively militarizing aspects of border enforcement while maintaining standard limitations regarding executive authority and appropriations.",
  "eli5": "The President signed a special order that tells the military to help protect America's borders. It's like asking soldiers to be extra security guards at the country's doorways to stop people from entering illegally or bringing in dangerous things.",
