  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to resume previous efforts to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to other parts of California, particularly the Central Valley and Southern California. The memo specifically challenges California's previous lawsuit that halted these water infrastructure improvements during the prior administration, which were stopped due to concerns about protecting the Delta smelt and other fish species. The memorandum argues that the current situation results in wasteful water flow into the Pacific Ocean and cites recent wildfires as evidence of Southern California's urgent need for a reliable water supply. The directive requires the Secretaries to report back within 90 days on implementation progress and recommendations.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to change how water flows in California to help more people get the water they need, even though some people are worried this might hurt fish that live in the rivers. It's like choosing whether to share a glass of water with thirsty people or save it for fish in an aquarium.",
