  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to resume previous Trump administration efforts to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Central Valley and Southern California. The memorandum argues that protecting the Delta smelt and other fish species has resulted in water being 'wastefully' released into the Pacific Ocean rather than being used for human needs. It cites recent wildfires as evidence of the need for better water management. The directive requires the Secretaries to report back within 90 days on implementation progress and recommendations.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to change how water is shared in California. Instead of letting lots of water flow to the ocean to help fish survive, he wants to send more water to people in Southern California who need it for drinking and fighting fires.",
