  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to resume previous Trump administration efforts to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Central Valley and Southern California. The memo argues that current water management practices allow water to flow 'wastefully' into the Pacific Ocean in the name of protecting fish species like the Delta smelt. It positions the directive as a response to destructive wildfires in Southern California and criticizes previous California state litigation that blocked similar water management changes. The Secretaries are required to report back within 90 days on implementation progress and recommendations.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to change how California's water is shared. Instead of letting lots of water flow to the ocean to help fish survive, he wants to send more water to farms and cities in Southern California where people need it, especially to help fight fires.",
