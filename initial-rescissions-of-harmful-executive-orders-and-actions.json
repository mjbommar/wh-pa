ACTIONS\n===========================================================\n\nEXECUTIVE ORDER \nJanuary 20, 2025 \n\n\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it\u00a0is\u00a0hereby ordered as follows:\n\nSection 1.\u00a0 Purpose and Policy.\u00a0 The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government. \u00a0The injection of \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI) into our institutions has corrupted them by replacing hard work, merit, and equality with a divisive and dangerous preferential hierarchy. \u00a0Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved Federal, State, and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. \u00a0Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.\n\nTo commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe, and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United\u00a0States to restore common sense to the Federal Government and unleash the potential of the American citizen. \u00a0The revocations within this order will be the first of many steps the United States Federal Government will take to repair our institutions and our economy.\n\nSec. 2.\u00a0 Revocation

  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, represents a significant policy shift by revoking numerous Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda issued during the previous administration (2021-2025). The order specifically targets and rescinds policies related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), climate change, immigration, COVID-19 response, healthcare, education, and various administrative appointments. The stated purpose is to 'restore common sense to the Federal Government' by eliminating what the order characterizes as 'deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices.' The order directs agency heads to immediately cease DEI implementation and requires reviews by the Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council, and National Security Advisor to identify additional actions for rescission.",
