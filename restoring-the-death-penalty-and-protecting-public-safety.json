or\n\n(ii) \u00a0A capital crime committed by an alien illegally present in this country.\n\nThe Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes with special attention to the crimes described in Subsections (i) and (ii), regardless of whether the federal trial results in a capital sentence.\n\n(d) \u00a0The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to modify the Justice Manual based on the policy and purpose set forth in this Executive Order.\n\n(e) \u00a0The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose. \u00a0The Attorney General shall further evaluate whether these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 Preserving Capital Punishment in the States. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Attorney General shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection.\n\n(b) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to approve or deny any pending request for certification made by any State under 28 U.S.C. 2265.\n\nSec. 5.\u00a0 Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder Capital Punishment.\u00a0 The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.\n\nSec. 6.\u00a0 Prosecuting Crime to Protect Communities. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Attorney General shall appropriately prioritize public safety and the prosecution of violent crime, and take all appropriate action necessary to dismantle transnational criminal activity in the United States.\n\n(b) \u00a0To ensure the fullest protection of American communities from violence, the Attorney General shall encourage state attorneys general and district attorneys to adopt policies and practices aligned with subsection (a). \u00a0Federal law enforcement should coordinate with State and local law enforcement where possible to facilitate these objectives.\n\nSec. 7.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0 the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) \u00a0the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) \u00a0This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, establishes a policy to reinstate and strengthen federal capital punishment. The order directly challenges President Biden's prior moratorium on federal executions and his December 2024 commutation of 37 death row inmates. The order directs the Attorney General to aggressively pursue death penalty cases, particularly for crimes involving law enforcement officers or illegal aliens. It mandates reviewing imprisonment conditions for previously commuted inmates and facilitating states' access to lethal injection drugs. The AG is also directed to challenge Supreme Court precedents limiting capital punishment and coordinate with state/local law enforcement to prioritize violent crime prosecution.",
  "eli5": "This is a rule that says the government wants to bring back and use the death penalty (putting criminals to death as punishment) more often, especially for people who commit really bad crimes. It changes some earlier rules that had made it harder to use the death penalty.",
