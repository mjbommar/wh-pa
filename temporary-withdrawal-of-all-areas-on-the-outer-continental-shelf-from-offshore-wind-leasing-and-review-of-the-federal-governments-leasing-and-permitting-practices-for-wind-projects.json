  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum, dated January 20, 2025, implements a significant pause on offshore and onshore wind energy development. The order has three major components: 1) It withdraws all areas of the Outer Continental Shelf from wind energy leasing, effective January 21, 2025, until revoked; 2) It halts all new or renewed approvals for onshore and offshore wind projects pending a comprehensive review of federal leasing and permitting practices; and 3) It specifically addresses the Lava Ridge Wind Project, placing a moratorium on activities and requiring a new analysis. The order also calls for an assessment of environmental impacts and costs related to defunct windmills. While existing lease rights are preserved, the Secretary of Interior must review these for potential termination or amendment.",
  "eli5": "The President is telling everyone to stop building new wind farms in the ocean and on land for a while. The government wants to study whether these wind farms might hurt animals, cost too much money, or cause other problems before letting anyone build more of them.",
