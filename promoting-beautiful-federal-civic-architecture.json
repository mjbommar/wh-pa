  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the GSA Administrator to provide recommendations within 60 days regarding Federal building architecture. The directive emphasizes that Federal buildings should be visually recognizable as civic structures and reflect regional, traditional, and classical architectural styles. The memorandum requires reviewing and potentially revising the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture and establishing procedures for community input in design selection. Additionally, it institutes a notification requirement if the GSA Administrator intends to approve designs that deviate from these principles, requiring 30-day advance notice through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.",
