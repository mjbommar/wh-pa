  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the GSA Administrator to develop recommendations within 60 days for ensuring Federal public buildings embody civic architecture that reflects traditional and classical design elements while respecting regional architectural heritage. The directive aims to make government buildings clearly identifiable and enhance public spaces. The memorandum requires the GSA to consult with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and other agency heads as needed. Additionally, it establishes a notification requirement if the GSA plans to approve designs that deviate from these principles, mandating 30-day advance notice through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy before rejecting alternative designs that would incur substantial costs.",
  "eli5": "The President wants government buildings to look nice and special, like important buildings from history. He's asking people to make rules about how to design new government buildings so they look more beautiful and make people proud of their country.",
