  "summary": "This Executive Order establishes a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation and blockchain technology in the United States. The order has several key components: (1) it promotes the responsible growth of digital assets and blockchain technology, (2) protects individual rights to access and use public blockchain networks, (3) supports dollar-backed stablecoins, (4) ensures fair banking access, and (5) explicitly prohibits the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The order establishes a President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets within the National Economic Council, chaired by a Special Advisor for AI and Crypto. It also revokes previous Executive Order 14067 and the Treasury Department's Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets. The Working Group is tasked with developing regulatory recommendations and considering the creation of a national digital asset stockpile.",
