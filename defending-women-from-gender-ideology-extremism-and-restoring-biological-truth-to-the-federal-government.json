GOVERNMENT\n=======================================================================================================\n\nEXECUTIVE ORDER \nJanuary 20, 2025 \n\n\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\n\nSection 1. \u00a0Purpose. \u00a0Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women\u2019s domestic abuse shelters to women\u2019s workplace showers. \u00a0This is wrong. \u00a0Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being. \u00a0The erasure of sex in language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women but on the validity of the entire American system. \u00a0Basing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\n\nThis unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.\u00a0 Invalidating the true and biological category of \u201cwoman\u201d improperly transforms laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\n\nAccordingly, my Administration will defend women\u2019s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy and Definitions. \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. \u00a0These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. \u00a0Under my direction, the Executive Branch will enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality, and the following definitions shall govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy:\n\n(a) \u00a0\u201cSex\u201d shall refer to an individual\u2019s immutable biological classification as either male or female. \u00a0\u201cSex\u201d is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\n(b) \u00a0\u201cWomen\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d shall mean adult and juvenile human females, respectively.\n\n(c) \u00a0\u201cMen\u201d or \u201cman\u201d and \u201cboys\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d shall mean adult and juvenile human males, respectively.\n\n(d) \u00a0\u201cFemale\u201d means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.\n\n(e) \u00a0\u201cMale\u201d means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.\n\n(f) \u00a0\u201cGender ideology\u201d replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and requiring all institutions of society to regard this false claim as true. \u00a0Gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one\u2019s sex.\u00a0 Gender ideology is internally inconsistent, in that it diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\n\n(g) \u00a0\u201cGender identity\u201d reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an infinite continuum, that does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Recognizing Women Are Biologically Distinct From Men. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public clear guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in this order.\n\n(b) \u00a0Each agency and all Federal employees shall enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes. \u00a0Each agency should therefore give the terms \u201csex\u201d, \u201cmale\u201d, \u201cfemale\u201d, \u201cmen\u201d, \u201cwomen\u201d, \u201cboys\u201d and \u201cgirls\u201d the meanings set forth in section 2 of this order when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications.\n\n(c) \u00a0When administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all Federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term \u201csex\u201d and not \u201cgender\u201d in all applicable Federal policies and documents.\n\n(d) \u00a0The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder\u2019s sex, as defined under section 2 of this order; and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report Federal employees\u2019 sex, as defined by section 2 of this order.\n\n(e) \u00a0Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. \u00a0Agency forms that require an individual\u2019s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.\u00a0 Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.\n\n(f) \u00a0The prior Administration argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces under, for example, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act.\u00a0 This position is legally untenable and has harmed women.\u00a0 The Attorney General shall therefore immediately issue guidance to agencies to correct the misapplication of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities.\u00a0 In addition, the Attorney General shall issue guidance and assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions, which are explicitly permitted under Constitutional and statutory precedent.\n\n(g) \u00a0Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.\u00a0 Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Privacy in Intimate Spaces*.* (a)\u00a0 The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that males are not detained in women\u2019s prisons or housed in women\u2019s detention centers, including through amendment, as necessary, of Part 115.41 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations and interpretation guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\n(b) \u00a0The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall prepare and submit for notice and comment rulemaking a policy to rescind the final rule entitled \u201cEqual Access in Accordance with an Individual\u2019s Gender Identity in Community Planning and Development Programs\u201d of September 21, 2016, 81 FR 64763, and shall submit for public comment a policy protecting women seeking single-sex rape shelters.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no Federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\n\n(d) \u00a0Agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are designated by sex and not identity.\n\nSec. 5. \u00a0Protecting Rights. \u00a0The Attorney General shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u00a0 In accordance with that guidance, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the General Counsel and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and each other agency head with enforcement responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act shall prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified.\n\nSec. 6.\u00a0 Bill Text. \u00a0Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs shall present to the President proposed bill text to codify the definitions in this order.\n\nSec. 7. \u00a0Agency Implementation and Reporting. \u00a0(a) \u00a0Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency head shall submit an update on implementation of this order to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. \u00a0That update shall address:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0changes to agency documents, including regulations, guidance, forms, and communications, made to comply with this order; and\n\n(ii) \u00a0agency-imposed requirements on federally funded entities, including contractors, to achieve the policy of this order.\n\n(b) \u00a0The requirements of this order supersede conflicting provisions in any previous Executive Orders or Presidential Memoranda, including but not limited to Executive Orders 13988 of January 20, 2021, 14004 of January 25, 2021, 14020 and 14021 of March 8, 2021, and 14075 of June 15, 2022.\u00a0 These Executive Orders are hereby rescinded, and the White House Gender Policy Council established by Executive Order 14020 is dissolved.\n\n(c) \u00a0Each agency head shall promptly rescind all guidance documents inconsistent with the requirements of this order or the Attorney General\u2019s guidance issued pursuant to this order, or rescind such parts of such documents that are inconsistent in such manner. \u00a0Such documents include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality\u201d;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0the Department of Education\u2019s guidance documents including:\n\n(A)\u00a0 \u201c2024 Title IX Regulations: Pointers for Implementation\u201d (July 2024);\n\n(B)\u00a0 \u201cU.S. Department of Education Toolkit: Creating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students\u201d;\n\n(C)\u00a0 \u201cU.S. Department of Education Supporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School\u201d (June 21, 2023);\n\n(D)\u00a0 \u201cDepartamento de Educaci\u00f3n de EE.UU.\u00a0 Apoyar a los j\u00f3venes y familias LGBTQI+ en la escuela\u201d (June 21, 2023);\n\n(E)\u00a0 \u201cSupporting Intersex Students: A Resource for Students, Families, and Educators\u201d (October 2021);\n\n(F)\u00a0 \u201cSupporting Transgender Youth in School\u201d (June 2021);\n\n(G)\u00a0 \u201cLetter to Educators on Title IX\u2019s 49th Anniversary\u201d (June 23, 2021);\n\n(H)\u00a0 \u201cConfronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools: A Resource for Students and Families\u201d (June 2021);\n\n(I)\u00a0 \u201cEnforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v.

  "summary": "This Executive Order establishes a significant shift in federal policy regarding sex and gender identity. It defines sex as a binary, biological classification (male/female) and explicitly rejects the concept of gender identity in federal policy. The order requires all federal agencies to: 1) Use only biological sex-based definitions in policies and documents; 2) Remove references to gender ideology; 3) Maintain sex-based distinctions in intimate spaces; 4) Ensure federal funds don't promote gender ideology; and 5) Protect women's single-sex spaces. It rescinds several Obama/Biden-era executive orders and guidance documents related to gender identity protections. The order directs specific actions from various agencies, including HHS, State Department, DOJ, and Department of Education, to implement these changes.",
  "eli5": "This is a rule that says the government will only recognize people as either boys/men or girls/women based on their biology when they were born. It removes rules that let people choose their gender identity and changes how the government handles things like bathrooms and sports teams.",
