and\n\n(g) \u00a0Obtaining complete operational control of the borders of the United States.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Physical Barriers. \u00a0The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate action to deploy and construct temporary and permanent physical barriers to ensure complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0Deployment of Personnel. \u00a0(a) \u00a0The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take all appropriate and lawful action to deploy sufficient personnel along the southern border of the United States to ensure complete operational control;

  "summary": "This Executive Order outlines a comprehensive approach to border security and immigration enforcement. It establishes policies to construct physical barriers along the southern border, expand detention capacity, resume the Migrant Protection Protocols (\"Remain in Mexico\"), terminate certain parole programs, and enhance law enforcement efforts. The order directs multiple federal agencies to coordinate on border security, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State, and Justice. Key provisions include mandating detention of apprehended individuals, ending \"catch-and-release\" practices, implementing DNA testing requirements, and prioritizing prosecution of border-related crimes including human trafficking. The order also calls for new international agreements and cooperation to manage migration flows.",
  "eli5": "The President wants to make the country's borders more secure by building walls, adding more guards, and making sure people who try to enter the country without permission are sent back home instead of being allowed to stay. It's like making sure your house has strong locks and only letting in people who have permission to visit.",
