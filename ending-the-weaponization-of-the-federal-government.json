  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, directs a comprehensive review of federal law enforcement and intelligence activities from the previous administration. The Order alleges that the prior administration weaponized federal agencies against political opponents through investigations, prosecutions, and enforcement actions. It requires the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to review actions taken over the previous 4 years and submit reports identifying potential misconduct and recommending remedial actions. The Order emphasizes document retention requirements and includes standard provisions limiting its scope to existing legal authorities and available appropriations.",
  "eli5": "The new President wants to check if the last President used government agencies unfairly to hurt people who disagreed with them. It's like asking teachers to look back and make sure no students were treated unfairly because of who their friends were.",
  "issues": [
