TRUMP\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nJanuary 22, 2025\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order initiates the process to designate Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The order cites multiple hostile actions by the Houthis, including attacks on U.S. Navy vessels, civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and UAE, and disruption of maritime commerce in the Red Sea. It requires the Secretary of State to submit a designation report within 30 days and take appropriate action within 15 days thereafter. Additionally, it mandates USAID to review and potentially terminate relationships with organizations that have made payments to or insufficiently documented Houthi abuses.",
  "eli5": "The President is taking steps to officially call a group called the Houthis 'terrorists' because they have been attacking ships and hurting people in the Middle East. This will make it easier for the U.S. to stop them and protect people and ships.",
