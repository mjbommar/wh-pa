Purpose*.* \u00a0The energy and critical minerals (\u201cenergy\u201d) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation\u2019s needs. \u00a0We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation\u2019s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness. \u00a0Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation\u2019s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.\n\nThis active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation\u2019s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors. \u00a0Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition. \u00a0In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets. \u00a0An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.\n\nThe integrity and expansion of our Nation\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2014- from coast to coast -\u2014 is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States\u2019 national and economic security. \u00a0It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.\n\nMoreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy. \u00a0This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States\u2019 trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security. \u00a0Accordingly, our Nation\u2019s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.\n\nThe policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action. \u00a0Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology. \u00a0The United States\u2019 ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation\u2019s electrical grid. \u00a0Our Nation\u2019s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States\u2019 prosperity and national security.\n\nThese numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation\u2019s Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation\u2019s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population. \u00a0The United States\u2019 insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation\u2019s economy, national security, and foreign policy. \u00a0In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.\n\nSec. 2. Emergency Approvals*.* (a) \u00a0The heads of executive departments and agencies (\u201cagencies\u201d) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands. \u00a0If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81-774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq*.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\n(b) \u00a0Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.\n\nSec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure*.*(a)\u00a0 To facilitate the Nation\u2019s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.\n\n(b) \u00a0To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.\n\n(c) \u00a0The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\n\nSec. 4.Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers*.*(a) \u00a0Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation\u2019s energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Corps, or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the \u201cemergency Army Corps permitting provisions\u201d); and\n\n(ii) \u00a0shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). \u00a0Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.\n\n(b) \u00a0Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation\u2019s energy supply.\n\n(c) \u00a0Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ.
