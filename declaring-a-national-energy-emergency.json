  "summary": "This Executive Order declares a national emergency regarding energy security and infrastructure in the United States. The Order cites inadequate energy production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity as threats to national security and economic stability. It directs federal agencies to expedite energy infrastructure projects, particularly in the Northeast and West Coast regions, using emergency authorities. The Order establishes streamlined processes for environmental permits under the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, requires regular ESA Committee meetings, and mandates Defense Department assessment of energy vulnerabilities. Key provisions include emergency fuel waivers, expedited infrastructure approvals, and coordination between multiple federal agencies to address energy supply challenges.",
  "eli5": "The President declared an emergency because there isn't enough energy being made in America, which makes it hard for people to get affordable electricity and gas. The order tells government workers to speed up building new energy projects and make it easier to produce more energy in America.",
  "issues": [
    "The Order may face legal challenges over the scope of emergency powers being exercised",
