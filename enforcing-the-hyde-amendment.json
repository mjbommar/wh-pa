  "summary": "This Executive Order revokes two previous executive orders from 2022 (EO 14076 and EO 14079) that expanded access to reproductive healthcare services. The order aims to enforce the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for elective abortions. The order directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance to federal agencies on implementation. It includes standard provisions maintaining existing executive authority and clarifying that it creates no new legal rights or benefits. The order reflects a policy shift to restrict federal funding for abortion services, citing a 'longstanding consensus' against taxpayer funding of elective abortions.",
  "eli5": "This is a rule that says the government won't use tax money to pay for most abortions. It cancels some older rules that did allow government money to be used for this purpose.",
