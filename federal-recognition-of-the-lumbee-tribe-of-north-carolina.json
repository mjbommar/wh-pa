Sess. Laws 92. \u00a0In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Lumbee Act (Public Law 84-570, 70 Stat. 254), which recognized the Lumbee as the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina but denied Lumbee Indians Federal benefits associated with such recognition.\u00a0 Today, according to the State of North Carolina, the Lumbee Tribe consists of more than 55,000 members, making it the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River and the ninth-largest tribe in the Nation.\n\nIn 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed, by a vote of 311-96, the Lumbee Fairness Act (H.R. 1101), which would grant the Lumbee Tribe full Federal recognition, but this legislation was not considered by the United States Senate before the end of the 118th Congress.\u00a0 Similar legislation has passed the House of Representatives several times.\n\nConsidering the Lumbee Tribe\u2019s historical and modern significance, it is the policy of the United States to support the full Federal recognition, including the authority to receive full Federal benefits, of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.\n\nSec. 2.\u00a0 Directive for Recognition Plan. \u00a0(a)\u00a0 Within 90\u00a0days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Interior shall review all applicable authorities regarding the recognition or acknowledgement of Indian tribes and, in consultation with the leadership of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, shall submit to the President a plan to assist the Lumbee Tribe in obtaining full Federal recognition through legislation or other available mechanisms, including the right to receive full Federal benefits.\n\n(b)\u00a0 The plan shall include consideration and analysis of each potential legal pathway to effectuate full Federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, including through an act of the Congress, judicial action, or the Procedures for Federal Acknowledgement of Indian Tribes set forth in 25 C.F.R. Part 83.\n\n(c)\u00a0 The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the *Federal Register*.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a plan for achieving full federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The memo acknowledges the tribe's historical significance as descendants of Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan peoples, and notes their 1885 recognition by North Carolina and partial recognition under the 1956 Lumbee Act. Despite being the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River with over 55,000 members, the tribe currently lacks full federal benefits. The Secretary must submit a plan within 90 days that explores all potential legal pathways for federal recognition, including legislative, judicial, and administrative options.",
  "eli5": "The President is asking the government to help the Lumbee Tribe, a large Native American group in North Carolina, get officially recognized by the United States so they can receive the same benefits as other tribes. Right now, they're only partly recognized, which isn't fair.",
