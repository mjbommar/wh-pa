  "summary": "This Presidential Memorandum directs federal agencies to address perceived economic challenges attributed to the Biden Administration's policies. The memorandum claims that Biden-era regulations and spending have caused inflation and increased costs for American families. It specifically targets regulations related to energy, vehicle emissions, and housing construction. The document orders agency heads to pursue actions aimed at reducing costs in housing, healthcare, appliances, and energy sectors, while promoting employment opportunities. The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy must report on implementation progress every 30 days.",
  "eli5": "The President is telling government workers to find ways to make things cost less money for families. They need to look at making houses, doctor visits, home appliances, and gas cheaper, and help more people get jobs.",
