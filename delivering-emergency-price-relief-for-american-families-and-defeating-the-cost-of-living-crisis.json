  "summary": "This executive memorandum, dated January 20, 2025, directs federal agencies to address what it characterizes as an inflation crisis caused by the previous administration's policies. The order claims the Biden Administration's regulatory policies and spending increased costs for American families by approximately $50,000 per household. The memo specifically targets regulations affecting energy production, vehicle manufacturing, housing construction, and climate policies. It directs agency heads to take actions to reduce costs in housing, healthcare, appliances, and energy sectors while promoting employment. The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy must report on implementation progress every 30 days.",
  "eli5": "The President wrote a letter telling government workers to find ways to make things cost less money for families. Things like houses, cars, and food have gotten too expensive, so the President wants to change some rules to help make everything cheaper.",
