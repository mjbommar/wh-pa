  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) due to concerns about the nation's capacity to absorb refugees. The order cites strain on various cities and states, including recent emergency declarations in New York and Massachusetts. The suspension takes effect on January 27, 2025, with limited exceptions for case-by-case admissions when deemed in the national interest. The order requires the Department of Homeland Security to examine ways to increase state and local involvement in refugee placement decisions and submit reports every 90 days assessing whether USRAP resumption would serve U.S. interests. It also revokes a previous Executive Order (14013) related to refugee resettlement and climate change migration.",
  "eli5": "The President is putting a pause on letting refugees come into America because some cities and towns say they're having trouble taking care of all the new people arriving. The government will only let refugees in if there's a really special reason, and they'll check every few months to see if it's okay to start letting more people in again.",
