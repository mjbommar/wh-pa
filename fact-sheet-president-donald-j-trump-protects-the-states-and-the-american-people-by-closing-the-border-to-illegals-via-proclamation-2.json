Trump Re-designates the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization\n===================================================================================================\n\nJanuary 22, 2025 \n\n\n\nREVERSING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\u2019S REMOVAL OF THE HOUTHIS FROM THE FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION LIST: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order Re-Designating Ansar Allah (also known as the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\n* The Executive Order sets in motion a process by which Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, will be designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n  + President Trump designated the Iranian-backed Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in January 2021.\n  + Within one month of taking office, the Biden administration reversed the Houthis\u2019 designation.\n  + As a result of the Biden administration\u2019s weak policy, the Houthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times, launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure in partner nations, and attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times.\n  + The Executive Order directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with others, to recommend the re-designation of the Houthis within 30 days.\n* Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis\u2019 capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.\n* Following the Houthis\u2019 re-designation as an FTO, the Executive Order also directs the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Secretary of State to jointly review United Nations partners, nongovernmental organizations, and contractors operating in Yemen.\n\n* Following this review, the President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis\u2019 terrorism and abuses.\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order initiates the process to re-designate Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), reversing the Biden administration's 2021 removal of this designation. The order directs the Secretary of State to recommend re-designation within 30 days and establishes a policy framework for cooperating with regional partners to counter Houthi capabilities and operations. Additionally, it mandates a review of UN partners, NGOs, and contractors operating in Yemen, with potential termination of relationships with entities that have made payments to the Houthis or opposed counter-Houthi efforts.",
  "eli5": "The President signed a paper that says a group called the Houthis are dangerous terrorists who have been attacking ships and hurting people. The paper makes it against the rules to help this group and tells our government to work with other countries to stop them.",
