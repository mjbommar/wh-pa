all \u201cequity action plans,\u201d \u201cequity\u201d actions, initiatives, or programs, \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts; and all DEI or DEIA performance requirements for employees, contractors, or grantees.\n\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0 provide the Director of the OMB with a list of all:\n\n(A) \u00a0agency or department DEI, DEIA, or \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures in existence on November 4, 2024, and an assessment of whether these positions, committees, programs, services, activities, budgets, and expenditures have been misleadingly relabeled in an attempt to preserve their pre-November 4, 2024 function;\n\n(B) \u00a0Federal contractors who have provided DEI training or DEI training materials to agency or department employees; and\n\n(C) \u00a0Federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021.\n\n(iii) \u00a0direct the deputy agency or department head to:\n\n(A) assess the operational impact (e.g., the number of new DEI hires) and cost of the prior administration\u2019s DEI, DEIA, and \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d programs and policies; and\n\n(B) recommend actions, such as Congressional notifications under 28 U.S.C. 530D, to align agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions with the policy of equal dignity and respect identified in section 1 of this order. \u00a0The agency or department head and the Director of OMB shall jointly ensure that the deputy agency or department head has the authority and resources needed to carry out this directive.\n\n(c) \u00a0To inform and advise the President, so that he may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policies for the Executive Branch, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy shall convene a monthly meeting attended by the Director of OMB, the Director of OPM, and each deputy agency or department head to:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hear reports on the prevalence and the economic and social costs of DEI, DEIA, and \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d in agency or department programs, activities, policies, regulations, guidance, employment practices, enforcement activities, contracts (including set-asides), grants, consent orders, and litigating positions;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0discuss any barriers to measures to comply with this order; and\n\n(iii) \u00a0monitor and track agency and department progress and identify potential areas for additional Presidential or legislative action to advance the policy of equal dignity and respect.\n\nSec. 3.\u00a0 Severability. \u00a0If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.\n\nSec. 4.\u00a0 General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;

  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, aims to terminate all Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and related programs across the federal government. The order directs the dismantling of DEI initiatives implemented during the Biden administration, including those established under Executive Order 13985. It requires all federal agencies to terminate DEI offices, positions, and programs within 60 days, subject to legal limitations. The order mandates agencies to provide comprehensive reports on existing DEI programs, contractors, and grantees. It establishes a monitoring system through monthly meetings led by the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to track implementation and identify areas needing additional action. The order explicitly emphasizes merit-based employment practices and prohibits consideration of DEI factors in employee performance reviews.",
  "eli5": "This is a rule that stops the government from having special programs about diversity and inclusion. It's like saying everyone should be treated the same way, without having special groups or offices that focus on differences between people.",
