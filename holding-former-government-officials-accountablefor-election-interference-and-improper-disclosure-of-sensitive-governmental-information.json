Biden\u2019s son had abandoned his laptop at a computer repair business. \u00a0Signatories of the letter falsely suggested that the news story was part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nBefore being issued, the letter was sent to the CIA Prepublication Classification Review Board, the body typically assigned to formally evaluate the sensitive nature of documents prior to publication.\u00a0 Senior CIA officials were made aware of the contents of the letter, and multiple signatories held clearances at the time and maintained ongoing contractual relationships with the CIA.\n\nFederal policymakers must be able to rely on analysis conducted by the Intelligence Community and be confident that it is accurate, crafted with professionalism, and free from politically motivated engineering to affect political outcomes in the United States. \u00a0The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.\u00a0 This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a Presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country. \u00a0And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the Nation has been imperiled.\n\nNational security is also damaged by the publication of classified information.\u00a0 Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir for monetary gain after he was terminated from his White House position in 2019. \u00a0The book was rife with sensitive information drawn from his time in government. \u00a0The memoir\u2019s reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff.\u00a0 Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\n\nTo remedy these abuses of the public trust, this Order directs the revocation of any active or current security clearances held by: \u00a0(i) the former intelligence officials who engaged in misleading and inappropriate political coordination with the 2020 Biden presidential campaign; and (ii) John R. Bolton.\n\nSec. 2. \u00a0Policy. \u00a0(a) \u00a0It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the Intelligence Community not be engaged in partisan politics or otherwise used by a U.S. political campaign for electioneering purposes.\u00a0 The term \u201cIntelligence Community\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 3003 of title 50, United States Code.\n\n(b) \u00a0It is the policy of the United States that individuals who hold government-issued security clearances should not use their clearance status to influence U.S. elections.\n\n(c) \u00a0It is the policy of the United States that classified information not be publicly disclosed in memoirs, especially those published for personal monetary gain.\n\nSec. 3. \u00a0Implementation.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Effective immediately, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, shall revoke any current or active clearances held by the following individuals:\n\n(1) \u00a0James R.

Brandmaeir and Brett Davis, are deceased.\n\n(b)\u00a0 Within 90 days of this order, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, shall submit a report to the President through the National Security Advisor that details:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0any additional inappropriate activity that occurred within the Intelligence Community, by anyone contracted by the Intelligence Community or by anyone who held a security clearance, related to the letter signed by the 51 former intelligence officials;\n\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0recommendations to prevent the Intelligence Community or anyone who works for or within it from inappropriately influencing domestic elections; and\n\n(iii) \u00a0any disciplinary action\u2014including the termination of security clearances\u2014that should be taken against anyone who engaged in inappropriate conduct related to the letter signed by the 51 former intelligence officials.\n\nSec. 4. \u00a0General Provisions.\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii)\u00a0 the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) \u00a0This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c)\u00a0 This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 January 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

  "summary": "This Executive Order dated January 20, 2025, addresses two specific incidents involving former government officials: (1) the coordination of 51 former intelligence officials who signed a letter during the 2020 presidential campaign suggesting that news about President Biden's son's laptop was Russian disinformation, and (2) John Bolton's publication of a memoir containing sensitive information. The Order directs the revocation of security clearances for 50 named individuals (excluding two deceased signatories) and requires the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report within 90 days detailing any additional inappropriate activities, recommendations to prevent future election interference, and potential disciplinary actions. The Order establishes policy prohibiting Intelligence Community involvement in partisan politics and the disclosure of classified information in memoirs for personal gain.",
  "eli5": "The President signed a rule that takes away special security permissions from people who either spread misleading information during an election or shared secret government information they weren't supposed to share. It's like taking away someone's special password because they weren't following the rules about keeping secrets.",
