  "summary": "This Executive Order, dated January 20, 2025, directs the immediate withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement and other international climate agreements under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The order revokes the U.S. International Climate Finance Plan and directs various federal agencies to rescind related policies. The order emphasizes prioritizing American economic interests in international environmental agreements, arguing that the U.S. has successfully balanced economic growth with environmental protection through market-friendly policies. The order requires multiple federal agencies to report on their actions to revoke climate finance commitments and mandates that future international energy agreements prioritize economic efficiency and American prosperity.",
